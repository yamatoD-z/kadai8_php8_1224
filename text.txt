      Bills player Damar Hamlin is in critical condition after collapsing from a cardiac arrest on the field, team says
    
**************************
 
      Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is in critical condition after the 24-year-old suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday nightâs game in Cincinnati, his team said, a stunning moment that left players weeping, praying and embracing as their teammate was taken away by ambulance.
   
      Hamlin fell on his back just moments after getting up from an open field tackle of Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. It remains unclear what caused the cardiac arrest.

      âHis heartbeat was restored on the field and he was transferred to the (University of Cincinnati) Medical Center for further testing and treatment. He is currently sedated and listed in critical condition,â the Bills said in a tweet early Tuesday.
   
      Hamlinâs collapse left players distraught â in tears, kneeling with arms around one another before returning to their locker rooms. The game was suspended with nearly 6 minutes left in the first quarter and later was officially postponed. 
   
      
      What are cardiac arrest, heart attack and heart failure?
     
      Within 10 seconds of Hamlinâs collapse, Bills team trainers were treating him. An ambulance was on the field in less than five minutes, footage shows, and he was given CPR, according to an ESPN broadcast. âHamlin received immediate medical attention on the field by team and independent medical staff and local paramedics. He was then transported to a local hospital where he is in critical condition,â the NFL said in a statement. 
   
      Since then, support for Hamlin â a Pennsylvania native who had played every game this season â has poured in from fans and others in pro sports, from the NFLâs Russell Wilson and JJ Watt to NBA star LeBron James. A Christmas toy fundraiser Hamlin started in 2020 swiftly raised more than $3 million. 
   
      Hamlinâs collapse comes as the NFL remains under intense scrutiny over how it protects participants in an inherently violent game. Changes over the past decade include pregame medical assessments of players, plus on-field and postgame assessments of those involved in hard hits, the league has said. NFL protocols regarding concussions â injuries tied to brain disease later in life â have earned criticism this season after a quarterback suffered a hard hit in a game just four days after hitting his head on the turf in a game.
   
      The stunning play involving Hamlin happened around 8:55 p.m. ET, early in what initially was regarded as an important late-season matchup between two AFC stalwarts â the Bills at 12-3 and the Bengals at 11-4 â trying to stay in contention for top conference seeding in the approaching NFL playoffs.
   
      With the Bengals up 7-3, Higgins caught a short pass in Bengals territory and ran a few yards near midfield, where Hamlin met him.
   
      Higgins lowered his right shoulder and drove into the chest of Hamlin, whose arms were out wide anticipating a tackle. Hamlin, now falling back, managed to wrap his arms around Higginsâ shoulders and neck and twist Higgins to the ground with him.
   
      Hamlin stood up and appeared to adjust his face mask, then shortly afterward fell backward. A referee whistled for the clock to stop with 5:58 left in the quarter, and Bills staff rushed to the motionless player. 
   
      Soon, three teammates took their helmets off and knelt as Hamlin remained motionless. Minutes later, after two ESPN commercial breaks, most players for both teams were on the field looking on with concern, including Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs, shown with a tear-streaked face.
   
      Bills players and staff eventually gathered in a circle, kneeling on the field in prayer as an ambulance drove off the field with Hamlin.
   
      âAfter Hamlin was taken away by ambulance â¦ some players just sat staring out at the field; other players were hugging each other. Other guys were openly weeping,â ESPNâs Lisa Salters said in the live broadcast.
   
      By 9:16 p.m., after the teamsâ head coaches talked to each other on the field surrounded by game officials, Bills coach Sean McDermott motioned for his team to get back to their locker room, and the crowd was told the game would be temporarily suspended. The crowd cheered as players retreated to the tunnel.
   
      The league announced after 10 p.m. ET that the game was postponed.
   
      After his collapse Monday, neither of the teamsâ coaches or players asked to continue playing, NFL Executive Vice President of Operations Troy Vincent, who played in the league for over a decade, said in a press call. The NFL and the NFL Players Association agreed to postpone the game, the NFL statement said. 
   
      âIâve never seen anything like it since Iâve been playing,â Vincent said. âSo, immediately, my player hat went on. How do you resume play after youâve seen such a traumatic event occur in front of you in real time?â
   
      Some of Hamlinâs teammates decided to stay in Cincinnati while the rest of the team travels back Tuesday morning to Buffalo, Vincent said. Diggs, the Bills receiver, arrived at the hospital where Hamlin was being treated late Monday night, ESPNâs broadcast showed.
   
      CNN has reached out to the Bills for comment.
   
      Hamlin joined the Bills in 2021 as a sixth-round draft pick after playing for the University of Pittsburgh in the 2016-20 seasons. He was redshirted â sitting out on games while still on the team â in 2016 due to injury, his Pittsburgh Panthers player bio states. He also missed time due to injuries in 2017 and 2019, the NFL site added.
   
      Overwhelming support for him flooded in Monday night from fans and players across the sports world. The NFL Players Association tweeted Monday night that the organization and âeveryone in our community is praying for Damar Hamlin.â  
   
      âWe have been in touch with Bills and Bengals players, and with the NFL. The only thing that matters at this moment is Damarâs health and well being,â the players association said.

      Los Angeles Lakers basketball player James applauded the decision to postpone the game after the medical emergency. 
   
      âItâs definitely the right call,â he said after the Lakers game against the Charlotte Hornets Monday night, adding, âThe safety of players in all sports is always the most important. It was a terrible thing to see.â
   
      âMy thoughts and super prayers go up to the skies above for that kidâs family, for him, for that brotherhood of the NFL, and everybody whoâs a part of the NFL family,â James said. 
   
      Well wishes and prayers were sent by several star athletes, including Denver Broncos quarterback Wilson, Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields, Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, and free agent Odell Beckham Jr.
   
      Watt, an Arizona Cardinals defensive end, tweeted, âThe game is not important. Damar Hamlinâs life is important. Please be ok. Please.â
   
      In the hours after Hamlinâs collapse, the Christmas toy drive fundraiser he started had raised more than $3 million as it was flooded with donations from supporters rooting for his recovery.

      The player created the drive to raise money to buy toys for children in a Philadelphia community, writing at the time, âAs I embark on my journey to the NFL, I will never forget where I come from and I am committed to using my platform to positively impact the community that raised me.â
   
      In the hour after Hamlinâs cardiac arrest, the fundraiser had raised about $70,000 and less than 4,000 donations. But in just five hours, the GoFundMe skyrocketed to more than $3 million raised from almost 120,000 donations, some as high as $5,000 each. 
   
      Hamlin continued his annual toy drive tradition this year in Buffalo, signing autographs and jerseys for children who stopped by. 
   
      â(Itâs) something Iâve always been into, just giving back,â he told CNN affiliate WKBW in December, adding, âFor three years Iâve been doing the toy drive so just being able to extend it to Buffalo now is just something I love doing.â

      Jeremy Renner is in ICU recovering from 2 surgeries after being injured in snow plowing incident
    
**************************
 
      âHawkeyeâ actor Jeremy Renner is recovering from surgery after suffering âblunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuriesâ in a New Yearâs Day snow plowing accident in Nevada, a spokesperson for the actor said.
   
      As of Monday evening, Renner was in the intensive care unit in âcritical but stable condition,â the spokesperson said.
   
      The 51-year-old actor has so far undergone two surgeries to address injuries he sustained in the accident, a source close to the actor previously told CNN.
   
      
      Jeremy Renner suffered 'blunt chest trauma,' required second surgery for 'extensive' injuries
     
      Renner was hospitalized on Sunday after a âweather related accidentâ while plowing snow, his representative Sam Mast confirmed to CNN earlier on Monday.
   
      The Washoe County Sheriffâs Office said its deputies responded to a âtraumatic injuryâ involving Renner in the area of Mount Rose Highway in Reno.
   
      Deputies found Renner injured and coordinated his transport to an area hospital, the Sheriffâs Office said in a news release, adding that the actor was the only person involved in the accident.
   
      The Sheriffâs Office did not provide details on how the snow plow accident happened but said its Major Accident Investigation Team is looking into the circumstances of the incident.
   
      At the time of the accident, parts of western Nevada were covered with snow. The Reno area received around 6-12 inches of snow at elevations below 5,000 feet between New Yearâs Eve and New Yearâs Day, and up to 18 inches at higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Reno.
   
      Renner has shared multiple videos and photos on his verified social media accounts showing him in snowy conditions, including one Instagram video posted two weeks ago in which the actor appears to be driving a snowplow.
   
      Rennerâs family released a statement Monday evening thanking hospital staff and first responders as the actor remained hospitalized.
   
      âJeremyâs family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible doctors and nurses looking after him, Truckee Meadows Fire and Rescue, Washoe County Sheriff, Reno City Mayor Hillary Schieve and the Carano and Murdock families,â a statement from his spokesperson read. âThey are also tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans.â 
   
      Renner stars in the Paramount+ series âMayor of Kingstownâ and is best known for his role as Hawkeye in several Marvel Cinematic Universe films.

      Australiaâs top health adviser urged government against restrictions on travelers from China
    
**************************
 
      Australiaâs top medical officer advised the government against imposing any restrictions on travelers coming from China, a day before the health minister announced new testing requirements, internal documents show.
   
      Chinaâs Covid cases are surging after Beijing abandoned its costly zero-Covid strategy, prompting a number of countries to impose restrictions on travelers coming from China and its territories.
   
      Australia was among them, though a letter published on the government website on Tuesday, written by the countryâs Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, reveals that the decision was made despite his advice that it wasnât necessary.
   
      âBased on available information, and in the absence of a specific threat from a variant with increased pathogenicity and immune escape, I do not believe that there is sufficient public health rationale to impose any restriction or additional requirements on travelers from China,â Kelly wrote in the letter dated December 31. 
   
      In the letter, Kelly acknowledged widespread concern about the limited information being released by China about its outbreak, âwhich has highlighted some gaps in global surveillance.â 
   
      However, he added that he had consulted with health officers from other parts of the country and New Zealand, and found a âstrong consensusâ that targeted travel restrictions would be âinconsistent with the current national approach to the management of Covid-19 and disproportionate to the risk.â
   
      
      Chinese tourists are ready to travel abroad again. Here's why some countries are hesitant
     
      Regardless, the following day Australian Health Minister Mark Butler announced that from Thursday, travelers coming from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao must show proof of a negative Covid test taken within 48 hours of their departure. At the time, he said the new measures were due to the âlack of comprehensive informationâ about Chinaâs Covid situation and genomic sequencing data.
   
      After criticism that the government was ignoring medical advice, Butler told local radio on Tuesday that it was acting âout of an abundance of caution,â and that the measures were limited to arrivals from China because, until recently, it was the only âsignificant countryâ in the world that hadnât opened up.
   
      Australia is among more than a dozen countries that have imposed restrictions on travelers from China and its territories in the past week. Most, including the US, UK, and other parts of Europe and Asia, are requiring either a pre-departure test or testing on arrival, with arrivals found positive needing to quarantine.
   
      Morocco took the extra step of outright banning all travelers from China, regardless of nationality. The ban goes into effect on Tuesday, with no information on when it will be lifted or whether it applies to people traveling from Hong Kong and Macao, Chinaâs two special administrative regions.
   
      The measures have been controversial, with health experts and scientists around the world warning that these targeted restrictions are largely ineffective at preventing the spread of Covid or new variants â and that they could instead stoke racism and xenophobia.
   
      On Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning warned that China would take countermeasures against the travel restrictions.
   
      âSome countries have adopted entry restrictions targeting only China, which lack scientific basis, and some excessive practices are even more unacceptable,â she said, adding: âWe are firmly opposed to attempts to manipulate epidemic prevention and control measures for political purposes, and will take corresponding countermeasures for different situations in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.â
   
      Several experts told CNN there is currently no evidence of a new variant emerging from China, and that even if one were to arise, it would likely spread across the world anyway. Testing requirements donât catch all cases, especially with variants that have a shorter incubation period.
   
      A countryâs best defense was to make sure its own population was well protected through domestic policy, such as widespread vaccinations and basic public health measures, said Karen Grepin, an associate professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong.
   
      âIn a lot of parts of the world, the pandemic feels like itâs over â¦ but at the end of the day, (these measures) are ultimately what prevents the transmission of the virus,â she said, adding that thereâs âno point in worrying about imported cases, if youâre not going to do anything about domestic cases.â
   
      âIf countries are at the point where they think those things are no longer important, because for example theyâve developed so much population immunity, then why care about a couple of new cases coming in from China?â
   
      In his letter, Kelly argued that Australiaâs domestic situation was strong enough to avoid imposing restrictions, pointing to the countryâs âstrong surveillance mechanismsâ and high immunity levels â due to both vaccination and previous infection. 
   
      Instead of travel restrictions, he proposed several alternative measures including an aircraft wastewater testing program and voluntary sampling of incoming travelers on arrival.

      What are cardiac arrest, heart attack and heart failure?
    
**************************
 
      Heart disease is a leading killer around the world and the top cause of death in the United States. It killed an estimated 17.9 million people in 2019, representing 32% of all deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization.
   
      But not all heart disease is the same. It can affect the blood vessels to the heart or brain, heart muscles and valves, and other areas of the body. Cardiovascular diseases can require long-term treatment, or they can come on suddenly and seriously.
   
      Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, 24, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday nightâs game between the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals, his team said. Itâs not clear what caused his cardiac arrest.
   
      Cardiac arrest results from electrical disturbances that cause the heart to suddenly stop beating properly.
   
      In cardiac arrest, death can result quickly if steps arenât taken immediately. âCardiac arrest may be reversed if CPR is performed and a defibrillator shocks the heart and restores a normal heart rhythm within a few minutes,â according to the American Heart Association.
   
      
      Bills player Damar Hamlin is in critical condition after collapsing from a cardiac arrest on the field, team says
     
      More than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the United States each year, the AHA said.
   
      A sudden, unexpected loss of heart function also results in a sudden loss of breathing and consciousness.
   
      Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack, although almost any known heart condition, including heart attack, can cause cardiac arrest.
   
      Another emergency that can lead to cardiac arrest, commotio cordis, is a disruption of heart rhythm after a blow to the area directly over the heart at a key time during a heartbeat cycle. 
   
      Itâs rare, but it mostly occurs in boys and young men during sports. The American Heart Association says itâs the leading cause of deaths in youth baseball in the United States, typically two to three per year. Automated external defibrillators have helped increase the survival rate.
   
      Unlike cardiac arrest, a heart attack is a circulation problem. When circulation is blocked or cut off in some way and blood is no longer supplied to the heart muscle, this can damage that muscle â itâs commonly described as a heart attack; doctors may refer to it as âmyocardial infarction.â
   
      
      Sleep duration matters for heart health, according to new recommendations
     
      Blockages causing heart attacks are mostly caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries. Plaque forms when cholesterol combines with fat, calcium and other substances in the blood. 
   
      Combined, these elements harden into plaque, which can then rupture, causing a blood clot to form. Large clots can completely block the flow of blood through an artery. 
   
      âPeople who are at risk for heart attacks are people who have a family history of heart attack, having high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of exercise, cigarette smoking â the major risk factors we always discuss,â Dr. Nieca Goldberg, medical director of Atria New York City and clinical associate professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, previously told CNN.
   
      
      Task force's updated guidelines do not recommend daily aspirin for heart health for most adults
     
      Another less frequent cause of a heart attack is a spasm caused by tobacco or possibly illicit drugs, such as cocaine, which disables the heart muscle, according to the American Heart Association. A tear in the artery, though rare, can also result in a heart attack.
   
      Heart attacks can be fatal, but they do not automatically lead to death. Immediate emergency medical help can often prevent a serious outcome.
   
      âIf you think someone is having an heart attack, call 911. Donât wait,â Goldberg said, explaining that the reason itâs important to take an ambulance to the hospital instead of catching a ride with a family member or friend. An ambulance is equipped to offer treatment on the way to the hospital.
   
      Common warning signs of a heart attack are discomfort or pain in the chest; discomfort in other areas of the upper body, including pain in in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach; and shortness of breath. Other possible signs include cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.
   
      Overall, heart attacks are more common than cardiac arrest in the United States. 
   
      Heart failure is condition that occurs when the heart, essentially a pump, cannot effectively push blood out through the arteries and circulatory system to the bodyâs other organs and tissues. 
   
      
      Don't bother with dietary supplements for heart health, study says
     
      Congestive heart failure, a worsening of this general condition, means blood flow from the heart through the arteries has slowed while blood returning to the heart through the veins has begun to back up and combined they cause congestion â a blood traffic jam â in the bodyâs tissues. 
   
      The result is edema, or swelling, usually in the legs and ankles, though edema can happen anywhere in the body. Heart failure also impairs the kidneysâ ability to dispose of water and sodium, causing even more swelling. When pulmonary edema happens, fluid collects in the lungs and interferes with breathing.
   
    Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
   
      Conditions that can lead to heart failure include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and coronary artery disease: when plaque builds up in the walls of arteries causing them to narrow and increasing the difficulty of pumping blood. 
   
      Heart failure is a medical condition that needs to be treated to prevent a life-threatening heart attack, but is not as immediately life threatening as heart attack or cardiac arrest.

      âThis made us all unemployableâ: Trump White House aides respond to January 6 in angry text exchange
    
**************************
 
      A text exchange between Ivanka Trumpâs chief of staff Julie Radford and White House aide Hope Hicks reveals their anger over then-President Donald Trumpâs actions on January 6, 2021, hurting them professionally, according to newly released documents collected by the House select committee investigating the Capitol Hill insurrection.
   
      âIn one day he ended every future opportunity that doesnât include speaking engagements at the local Proud Boys chapter,â Hicks wrote to Radford on January 6, 2021. âAnd all of us that didnât have jobs lined up will be perpetually unemployed. Iâm so mad and upset. We all look like domestic terrorists now.â
   
      Hicks added: âThis made us all unemployable. Like untouchable. God Iâm so f***ing mad.â
   
      Radford responded by texting, âI know, like there isnât a chance of finding a job,â and indicating she already lost a job opportunity from Visa, which sent her a âblow off email.â 
   
      The new release is part of a steady stream of documents from the committee, complementing the release of its sweeping 845-page report. The latest comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans on Tuesday at the start of the new Congress.
   
      In the text messages, Hicks then says âAlyssa looks like a genius,â an apparent reference to Alyssa Farah Griffin resigning from her post as a White House aide one month before the attack on the US Capitol.
   
      Hicks and Radford then discuss Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trumpâs in-law Karlie Kloss, the supermodel, tweeting that Trumpâs response to the election was anti-American.
   
      âUnreal,â Radford texted.
   
      The committee also released call logs from the days leading up to January 6, 2021 painting a fuller picture of who the former president was speaking to as he and his allies were plotting for him to stay in office, the first time the panel is releasing White House call logs in their entirety. 
   
      The logs have been crucial to the panelâs investigation in piecing together a timeline of events. While the log for January 6 has a seven-hour gap, the committee has gone to great lengths to fill in that part of the timeline through witness interviews and other records.
   
      The day before the US Capitol attack, Trump spoke to then-Vice President Mike Pence. After that conversation, Trump spoke with Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who helped fuel Trumpâs election lies in the state, and then the switchboard operator left a note âthat Senator Douglas Mastriano will be calling in for the Vice President.â
   
      Trump also talked to a number of members of Congress on January 5, including Sens. Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Trump and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri tried calling each other many times but could not connect. Trump also spoke with John Eastman, who helped Trump create the fake elector scheme that day.
   
      The January 2 call log shows what happened in the immediate aftermath of the infamous hour-long call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger when Trump asked Raffensperger to âfindâ votes for him to win the state. Once the call with Raffensperger wrapped, Trump had a zoom with his then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani and spoke on the phone with his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and later Steve Bannon.
   
      On January 3, Trump had multiple calls with former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark and GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, as the former President tried and ultimately failed to install Clark as the acting head of DOJ. The call logs reflect a flurry of calls with DOJ officials, including then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue.
   
      At 4:22 p.m. ET that day, Clark is listed as acting attorney general, but earlier in the day he was not.
   
      Newly released documents also show the Secret Service dispatched a security team to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, just a few minutes after Trump announced unexpectedly during his Ellipse speech that he would join marchers headed there. 
   
      At about 1:10 p.m. ET, Trump called for supports to âwalk down Pennsylvania Avenueâ with him to the Capitol. Internal communications released by the House select committee show the Secret Service Joint Operations Center Counter Surveillance Unit sent an email around 1:15 p.m. ET, alerting that Trump had announced âon LIVE TV that he plans head to the Capitol with the crowd,â although his name is redacted.  
   
      âPer the announcement of (redacted) to the Capitol, a response team is being dedicated to the capitol,â agents wrote in the email. Publicly released internal communications frequently redact the code name agents use to refer to the president.
   
      The newly released documents provide fresh insight into how the Secret Service scrambled to respond to the chaos that unfolded that day. The email from the joint operations center shows the agency rushed to provide more security to the Capitol as a direct result of the former presidentâs comments. 
   
      Secret Service leadership was concerned about Trumpâs sudden plan to go to the Capitol, and the head of his detail was told the idea was ânot advisable,â the documents released by the committee show. They also detail how the agency ran into technical difficulties and confiscated dozens of weapons on January 6, and had warned about the Proud Boysâ violent intentions as early as December 27.
   
      Multiple units within the Secret Service were reporting technical problems, and agents were warned ânot to relyâ on their technology, according to an email. A timeline provided to the committee by the Secret Service shows some Secret Service radios died at the height of the chaos, but itâs not clear which protective teams were most affected. 
   
      Another document details how the Secret Service confiscated hundreds of cans of pepper spray, body armor, and hundreds of weapons such as knives and blunt weapons from the roughly 28,000 people who poured through the magnetometers on the way to the Ellipse.  
   
      In the wake of January 6, 2021, Dan Scavino, the former deputy chief of staff and social media director in Trumpâs White House, texted a rally organizer that Trump âdoes do his own tweetsâ after discussing the now infamous âwill be wildâ tweet on December 19, according to documents released by the select committee. 
   
      The panel and security experts have pointed to that tweet from Trumpâs account, which promoted a big protest planned for January 6, as a catalyst for the violence that day.
   
      In a text exchange between Scavino and Katrina Pierson, who helped organize the Ellipse rally that preceded the US Capitol attack, the pair were discussing a news article connecting right-wing rally organizer Alexander Ali to the former president.
   
      âI never spoke with Ali. â¦ He is a fraud, and the DJT tweet on December 19 had absolutely nothing to do with Ali, or any of his people,â Scavino texted, before adding: âHe does do his own tweets.â

      Idaho killings suspect is expected to waive extradition at Tuesday hearing
    
**************************
 
      The suspect in the November slaying of four University of Idaho students may soon be in Idaho to face first-degree murder charges if â as expected â he doesnât challenge his extradition to the Gem State in a Tuesday hearing in Pennsylvania.
   
      Bryan Kohbergerâs state-appointed attorney has indicated his client plans to waive extradition from his home state and has called the hearing a âformality proceeding.â 
   
      All the commonwealth needs to prove is that his client resembles or is the person on the arrest warrant and that he was in the area at the time of the crimes, Monroe County Chief Public Defender Jason LaBar told CNNâs Jean Casarez.
   
      
      What we still don't know about the suspect in the Idaho college student killings
     
      Kohberger was arrested Friday in Pennsylvania, almost seven weeks after Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, were found dead November 13 in an off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho. 
   
      Kohberger was âshocked a little bit,â LaBar told CNN a day after his client was arrested. Kohberger is presumed innocent until proven guilty, LaBar added in a statement. He âbelieves heâs going to be exonerated.â LaBar said in an interview on NBCâs âTodayâ show Tuesday.
   
      Kohberger has been âvery easy to talk to,â is âin a calm demeanorâ and understands the proceedings, including what to expect concerning his transport to Idaho and what to expect when he gets there, LaBar said.
   
      The 28-year-old suspect last month finished his first semester as a PhD student in the criminal justice program at Washington State Universityâs campus in Pullman, about a 15-minute drive west of Moscow.
   
      
      Suspect in the Idaho college student killings returned home for the holidays weeks after the crime. Here's what we know about him
     
      He drove home to Pennsylvania for the holidays, accompanied by his father, LaBar told CNN on Saturday. The two arrived in the commonwealth around December 17. 
   
      A white Hyundai Elantra authorities had been looking for in connection with the killings was found at Kohbergerâs parentsâ house, LaBar confirmed.
   
      Investigators focused on Kohberger as a suspect after tracing ownership of the Elantra, which had been seen in the area of the killings, to him, according to two law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation. Also, his DNA was matched to genetic material recovered at the home where the students were slain, the two sources said.
   
      An FBI surveillance team tracked Kohberger for four days before his arrest while law enforcement worked with prosecutors to develop enough probable cause to get a warrant, the two law enforcement sources said.
   
      Other than the DNA and the car, details such as whether Kohberger knew the victims â or a possible motive in the slayings â are not publicly known. The probable-cause affidavit, which would contain information to justify the suspectâs arrest, remains sealed until he appears in an Idaho court. 
   
      With those details still unknown, much public interest has focused on Kohbergerâs criminal justice studies. 
   
      He graduated with a bachelorâs degree in 2020 and this year completed his Master of Arts in criminal justice at DeSales University in Pennsylvania, according to a spokesperson for the university.
   
      In a post removed from Reddit after his arrest was announced, a student investigator associated with a DeSales University study named Bryan Kohberger sought participants for a research project âto understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision-making when committing a crime.â
   
      âIn particular, this study seeks to understand the story behind your most recent criminal offense, with an emphasis on your thoughts and feelings throughout your experience,â the post read.
   
      Moscow Police Department Chief James Fry said after the arrest that the investigation of the complex, extensive case was not over. 
   
      Investigators are still searching for pieces of evidence, Fry said, including the weapon used, believed to be a fixed-blade knife.
   
      âWe developed a clear picture over time,â he said, â(but) be assured that the work is not done. This is just started.â
   
      Kohberger is being held without bail in Pennsylvania, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said Friday. Once Kohberger is in Idaho, he is expected to make an initial appearance before a magistrate, and further hearings will be scheduled.

      George Santos set to be sworn in to Congress amid mounting scrutiny and condemnation
    
**************************
 
      Rep.-elect George Santos of New York is scheduled to be sworn in to Congress on Tuesday as he faces mounting scrutiny and condemnation over lies about his biography and amid an investigation by federal prosecutors into his finances. 
   
      
      All incoming members of the 118th Congress are scheduled to be sworn in following the vote for House speaker at the US Capitol, which is set to begin after noon ET on Tuesday. 
   
      Some Democrats have called on Santos to step aside after the Republican admitted to fabricating parts of his resume, including his work experience and education. A few Republicans have also rebuked Santos, and at least one of his fellow incoming House Republicans from New York called for him to face an ethics investigation. 
   
      Santos faces questions about other key parts of his biography â including a claim that has been contradicted that his grandparents survived the Holocaust â and over loans totaling more than $700,000 that he made to his 2022 campaign. The federal probe into his finances, which CNN reported on last week, is being undertaken by the US attorneyâs office in the Eastern District of New York. 
   
      Santos is also likely to face fraud charges in Brazil.
   
      Santosâ FEC reports contain a number of unusual expenditures, including exorbitant expenses on air travel and hotels.
   
      âCampaign expenditures for staff members including travel, lodging, and meals are normal expenses of any competent campaign. The suggestion that the Santos campaign engaged in any unlawful spending of campaign funds is irresponsible, at best,â Joe Murray, a lawyer for Santos, said in a statement to CNN on Saturday.
   
      House Republican leadership has remained silent on Santos and Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy has dodged questions from CNN and others on the issue. It is unlikely House GOP leadership will refuse to seat Santos on Tuesday, and Santos has said he intends to serve in Congress. 
   
      One veteran Republican lawmaker, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, said Sunday on Fox News that Santos is âcertainly going to have to consider resigning,â in the wake of the revelations, which were first reported by The New York Times last month. At least two Democrats â Reps. Joaquin Castro of Texas and Ted Lieu of CaliforniaÂ â have called for Santos to be expelled from Congress if he does not resign. The House has the power under the Constitution to expel any member with a two-thirds vote, but doing so is extremely rare and only five lawmakers have been expelled in US history.Â 
   
      Santos has apologized for some of the lies but has attempted to downplay the scope of the fabrications, arguing last week he only put âa little bit of fluffâ in his resume. 
   
      He admitted to lying about working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs and said he did not graduate from any college or university despite claiming he obtained degrees from Baruch College and New York University. Santosâ claims that his grandparents âsurvived the Holocaustâ as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium have been contradicted by sources reviewed by CNNâs KFile, including records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists. Santos has described himself as an âAmerican Jewâ and âLatino Jewâ on multiple occasions, but now says he is Catholic and that he was only jokingly describing himself as âJew-ish.â The Republican Jewish Coalition barred Santos from appearing at any of its events because he âmisrepresented his heritage.â
   
      CNNâs KFile has reported on several other false claims Santos has made, including that he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his familyâs real estate assets took a downturn. In December 2020, Santos falsely claimed that his mother âfled socialismâ in Europe and moved to the United States.
   
      Law enforcement officials in Brazil will reinstate fraud charges against Santos later this week, the Rio de Janeiro prosecutorâs office tells CNN.
   
      Prosecutors said they will seek a âformal responseâ from Santos related to a stolen checkbook in 2008, after police suspended an investigation into him because they were unable to find him for nearly a decade.
   
      CNN previously confirmed that Santos was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court in 2011, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. However, court records from 2013 state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.
   
      CNN has reached out to a lawyer for Santos for comment. The reinstatement of the fraud charges was first reported by The New York Times.
   
      In an interview with the New York Post last week, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil, saying: âI am not a criminal here â not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not. That didnât happen.â

Russia's war in Ukraine
**************************
 Live NFL star in critical condition Live Russia's war in Ukraine Live Start of new Congress  By Rhea Mogul, Jack Guy, Ed Upright, Adrienne Vogt, Mike Hayes and Leinz Vales, CNN Uncertainty still surrounds the death toll from a strike on Russian barracks in Makiivka, eastern Ukraine, with a top Russian war blogger questioning Moscow's official count. Elsewhere, Ukrainian authorities have charged two senior Russian commanders with crimes related to attacking Ukrainian civilians for the first time. Here are the latest headlines:  From CNN’s Arnaud Siad   French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed that Ukraine "needs our support more than ever,” as he hosted Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in Paris on Tuesday. The two leaders mentioned Sweden and Finland’s application to join NATO, with Macron saying Sweden can “count on France’s support and solidarity.” Kristersson said Sweden was “very grateful” for the “strong support,” adding “we are right now doing exactly what we said we were going to do to be able to enter the Alliance as soon as possible.” From CNN's Olga Voitovych and Mick Krever  Ukrainian authorities have for the first time charged two high-ranking Russian military commanders with crimes related to attacking Ukrainian civilians. Colonel-General Serhii Kobylash, commander of the Long-Range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, and Admiral Igor Osipov, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, were charged in absentia. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced Tuesday that it had “collected a high-quality evidence base against two representatives of the Russian high command, who are responsible for attacking civilian facilities in Ukraine.” The SBU said that Kobylash and Osipov were being charged under two sections of the Ukrainian criminal code: first with “planning, preparation, starting and conducting an aggressive war,” and second with “encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine.” “During the investigation, SBU investigators found that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Serhii Kobylash has been following the instructions of Russia's top military and political leadership to destroy Ukrainian cities,” the SBU said.  “It is on his orders that Russian invaders carry out massive missile attacks on residential buildings, hospitals and critical infrastructure in different regions of Ukraine.” The SBU accused Igor Osipov of ordering “systematic missile strikes from the Black Sea on Ukrainian densely populated settlements.” The Russian Ministry of Defense has not reacted to the charges, and CNN is unable to reach the accused directly. From CNN's Olga Voitovych in Kyiv Unseasonably warm weather in Ukraine is easing demand on the country’s electricity grid, the country’s state-owned electricity operator said Tuesday. “Due to warm weather, consumption in Ukraine is reduced,” Ukrenergo said on its official Facebook page.  “Power plants produce enough electricity to cover the load," it added. "In addition, due to clear weather in the morning and afternoon hours, the production of electricity by solar power plants is increased.” Nonetheless, Ukrenergo said that power restrictions would need to be implemented again by Tuesday afternoon as demand increased through the day, and urged Ukrainians to “consume electricity wisely.” Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, disrupting the supply of electricity, water and heat in the country this winter. From CNN's Mick Krever and Olly Racz   A top Russian military blogger, who just weeks ago received an award from President Vladimir Putin, has cast doubts on Moscow's official death toll from an attack on Russian barracks in occupied eastern Ukraine. Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias “WarGonzo,” posted a five-minute video on his Telegram channel Tuesday morning discussing what he called the “Makiivka tragedy.” “To the degree we can trust our own sources who work at the spot where this tragedy happened, they are still digging up the rubble at this moment. And unfortunately, the number of victims of this tragedy – the HIMARS strike on the quarters of both newly mobilized and the serving military, including National Guard – could be bigger.” In a rare admission, the Russian Ministry of Defense on Monday said that 63 servicemen had been killed in Makiivka when Ukraine used HIMARS missiles to attack a building where Russian soldiers were quartering. The Ukrainian military claims around 400 Russian soldiers were killed and a further 300 wounded, and says the exact number is “being clarified.” In any case, it would represent one of the deadliest single episodes of the war for Russian forces. Putin personally awarded Pegov with the “Order of Courage” at the Kremlin on December 20. Pegov is not alone is casting doubt on Russia’s official account.  Igor Girkin, a former official in the Russia-backed Donetsk People's Republic, suggested on Monday that the number of dead and wounded could run into the hundreds. “There are still no final figures on the number of casualties, as many people are still missing,” said Girkin, who was found guilty by a Dutch court of mass murder for his involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. From CNN's Mariya Knight and Tim Lister Kateryna and her husband Oleg endure what every citizen of Kyiv must – long blackouts, hours without any internet connection and constant apprehension about the next missile barrage. But as they begin 2023, they are also preparing for the arrival of twin boys. Kateryna, who is 34, is eight months pregnant. CNN agreed to use only first names for her and Oleg as they fear for their privacy. She’s not getting much rest ahead of the big day. The air-raid sirens blare almost every day, the crump of explosions is all too familiar. Their lives are shaped by the scheduled power cuts, as electricity is shared among the regions to mitigate the impact of Russia’s strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.  From CNN's Mariya Knight   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is planning a prolonged campaign of attacks with Iranian-made Shahed drones to exhaust Ukraine. “We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds. Its bet may be on exhaustion,” Zelensky said in his nightly address Monday. “On exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.”  Zelensky said Ukraine's main task is to ensure Russia's drone plans fail. He said more than 80 have been shot down over Ukraine since the start of 2023.  From CNN's Mariya Knight Some 40% of territories occupied after Feb. 24 — when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine — were liberated over the past year, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, said Monday. “The Armed Forces liberated 40% of the territories occupied during the full-scale invasion and 28% of all territories occupied by Russia since 2014,” he reported in a round-up post of 2022 on the Telegram app. The current front line is 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) long, the general said. According to Zaluzhny, Ukrainian Armed Forces have undergone military training in the territory of 17 European countries. From CNN's Mariya Knight and Denis Lapin The governor of Belgorod, a Russian region bordering Ukraine, reported shelling on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that "the village of Murom in the Shebekinsky urban district came under fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces.”  He said there were no casualties, but the shelling caused damage to two homes and a car. Gladkov also reported a local cemetery was hit by shelling.   According to Gladkov, the village of Vyazovoye in the Belgorod region also came under fire on Monday. “There were no casualties,” he said. “Windows of one private house were blown out, the facade and the fence were affected.”   “A power transmission line was also damaged,” Gladkov added. "Emergency services are on site and are dealing with the aftermath.”  Some background: Belgorod, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) from the Ukrainian border, has been struck previously. In December, the governor said one person was killed and eight others injured in strikes.

      âItâs like a constant gamble:â Ukrainian couple await birth of twins in wartime Kyiv
    
**************************
 
      Kateryna and her husband Oleg endure what every citizen of Kyiv must â long blackouts, hours without any internet connection and constant apprehension about the next missile barrage.  
   
      But as they begin 2023, they are also preparing for the arrival of twin boys. Kateryna, who is 34, is eight months pregnant. CNN agreed to use only first names for her and Oleg as they fear for their privacy. 
   
      Sheâs not getting much rest ahead of the big day. The air-raid sirens blare almost every day, the crump of explosions is all too familiar. Their lives are shaped by the scheduled power cuts, as electricity is shared among the regions to mitigate the impact of Russiaâs strikes on Ukraineâs energy infrastructure. 
   
      âOn New Yearâs Eve, I tried to take a nap,â she told CNN from her house in the Kyiv suburbs. âBut I woke to the sound of explosions, and they went on through the night. The sirens were on for much of the night, until 4:30 a.m.,â she said.  
   
      Itâs difficult for residents to distinguish between the sound of air defenses in operation and the impact of Russian cruise missiles and drones.
   
      âI donât mind the blackouts,â Kateryna said, âbut we worry about the next wave of Russian missiles. Will it be us? Itâs like a constant gamble.â 
   
      A nearby district â Vyshhorod â was hit a month ago, and the indiscriminate nature of the strikes means that residential districts are as much at risk as power plants and railway lines. Dozens of heath facilities across Ukraine, including maternity and childrenâs hospitals, have been struck since the beginning of the conflict.
   
      When the sirens arenât wailing, Kateryna said, there is another noise that is new to her neighborhood: the chattering of generators as homes and businesses try to compensate for being without electricity for as much as 12 hours a day.  
   
      âThey are the jingle bells of this Christmas,â she said.  
   
      Despite the risk and the imminent arrival of the twins, Kateryna still travels into central Kyiv twice a week to use one of the co-working spaces that have popped up across the Ukrainian capital.  
   
      These spaces have become quite professional, with furniture, heat, lighting and reliable internet, provided through Starlink terminals, bought from the company owned by Elon Musk.  
   
      Kateryna works in logistics, helping to import large containers into Ukraine. Itâs more than just a livelihood. Itâs also a way to contribute to the war effort. 
   
      Kateryna and Oleg are luckier than most Ukrainians in that they have a small generator at home, but they use it sparingly. There is always the risk of running out of diesel to power it â it uses a liter of fuel every hour and needs to cool down every four hours. They have to choose which appliances to run: itâs lights or laundry, they said.  
   
      They fully expect to need it long after the twins are born.
   
      Living in Kyiv during Russiaâs war on Ukraine is about being prepared. Kateryna and Oleg have cupboards full of batteries, power banks and flashlights. If the Russian missile campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure continues, as most expect it will, the scheduled power outages may become less predictable, with more emergency cuts.   
   
      There is enough food in the stores âbut sometimes I have to shop with a flashlight,â Kateryna says. They keep about two monthsâ worth of food supplies stacked in the house, just in case the situation goes from bad to worse. 
   
      Like many people from Kyiv, Kateryna and Oleg moved away from the capital to a safer area in western Ukraine when the invasion began last February. But they never wanted to leave the country. And soon they felt the draw of home pulling them back to the city.  
   
      âI have a job here; Oleg has a job here and he cannot work remotely. We have many friends here, our home. For me itâs a nightmare to move somewhere else,â Kateryna said.
   
      Kateryna feels they are both involved in the effort to secure Ukraineâs future. In the early months of her pregnancy, she helped Ukrainian volunteer organizations with fundraising for warm clothes and equipment for the Ukrainian army, she said.  
   
      âThe company my husband works for has a fund and they help the Ukrainian fighters who are on the front line with equipment like drones and pick-up trucks. We helped collect money for such equipment,â she said.
   
      Like many other Ukrainians, they helped a family that had fled the frontlines earlier in the war. The mother had given birth in the midst of Russian shelling of their hometown of Kreminna in eastern Luhansk region. When the family settled in a Kyiv suburb, Oleg and Kateryna helped them out with warm clothes and food.  
   
      Kateryna says she is not afraid of becoming a wartime mother. She and Oleg want their sons to grow up in an environment that would be the polar opposite of what life would be under Russian occupation.  
   
      âI really want my children to live in a free Ukraine, I want them to be safe. They have the right to safety and protection just like all other children in the world. I donât want them to live in fear of dying from a Russian rocket, they should be happy and carefree,â she said.  
   
      Her one concern â beyond giving birth to healthy children â is that she might find herself lying in the hospital amid another wave of missile attacks. At that point, she will pray very hard, she said.

NFL star Damar Hamlin in critical condition after cardiac arrest
**************************
 Live NFL star in critical condition Live Russia's war in Ukraine Live Start of new Congress  By Jessie Yeung, Aya Elamroussi, Rob Picheta, Seán Federico O'Murchú, Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt and Mike Hayes, CNN  Former National Football League player Donté Stallworth noted the difference in the league's attitude to player's safety as witnessed in its reaction to Buffalo Bills' Damar Hamlin's collapse at Monday night's game. “There’s been instances where players have been carted off, players have been taken off by ambulance and within five or 10 minutes the game has resumed," Stallworth told CNN on Tuesday morning. "We’ve never seen a game postponed because of an injury. Usually, games are postponed because of weather or some other kind of event that is not an injury." From CNN's Aditi Sangal   Indianapolis Colts safety Rodney McLeod Jr. said playing in the National Football League is a dream and it takes sacrifice, but the price shouldn't be someone's life. This comes after 24-year-old Buffalo Bills Safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday night’s game between the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals. He is currently in critical condition, his team says. "As players, injuries are always our deepest fear. ... But often, you know, we tend to try to remove any of those thoughts the moment we hit the field," he said, adding that it's common to see injuries like ligament tears, muscle strains, broken bones and concussions among others. "We've become very numb to it, unfortunately." However, Hamlin's collapse was unprecedented, he said. "What we saw last night was something that we've never have seen before. In my 11 years in the NFL, I never experienced anything like that, and that brings the reality [of] the sport to life."  He wished Hamlin, his family and his teammates well and added that he thinks the NFL handled the incident well. "I think they did a very good job. They put the concern of their players first," McLeod Jr. said. "[The teams] were not in the state of mind to be able to finish that game." From CNN's Adrienne Broaddus and Michelle Watson   Jordon Rooney, a friend and marketing representative of Damar Hamlin, said he's confident in Hamlin's ability to bounce back after collapsing on the field from cardiac arrest during a game on Monday.    "He's a fighter all the time; I mean if there's anyone that you know I have confidence in making it out of anything, it's him. He is someone who always figures out a way to come out on top," Rooney told CNN's Adrienne Broaddus Tuesday.    In his last conversation with Hamlin, Rooney said they were talking about his charitable contributions to the community.   "Our last conversation, it was talking about his toy drive. We had two toy drives – so talking about the success of it, he was excited," Rooney said. He also called Hamlin "strategic" and "personable."  Rooney said while he understands the fans desire to know more about Hamlin's status, he's asking for patience.   Rooney said he's not in an official capacity to speak on Hamlin's current medical condition. "To be honest, I can't speak on the medical stuff – like I'm just not well-versed enough to be able to give an expert opinion there," Rooney said. Despite the uncertainty of Hamlin's condition, Rooney said he's already looking forward to seeing Hamlin again.   "I'm excited for him to bounce back from this, because Damar is someone who, he will use things like this, adversity, and he'll make sure he inspires plenty of other people along the way," he said. In an earlier interview, Rooney said he met Hamlin when the player interned for him and the two have been good friends ever since.    "I actually know Damar because him being a division one football player, reached out to me to be an intern for me. Which is something that's pretty unique and the reason why is cause he's always interested in being an entrepreneur and wanted to build his own brand," Rooney told ABC's Robin Roberts on "Good Morning America." "He interned for me and then we just became super, super close so now, you know, we're partners in a business together. We collaborate on a lot of things and we're really good friends."   From CNN's Jamie Gumbrecht and Susan Scutti Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, 24, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday night’s game between the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals, his team said. It’s not clear what caused his cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest results from electrical disturbances that cause the heart to suddenly stop beating properly. In cardiac arrest, death can result quickly if steps aren’t taken immediately. “Cardiac arrest may be reversed if CPR is performed and a defibrillator shocks the heart and restores a normal heart rhythm within a few minutes,” according to the American Heart Association. More than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the United States each year, the AHA said. A sudden, unexpected loss of heart function also results in a sudden loss of breathing and consciousness. Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack, although almost any known heart condition, including heart attack, can cause cardiac arrest. Unlike cardiac arrest, a heart attack is a circulation problem. When circulation is blocked or cut off in some way and blood is no longer supplied to the heart muscle, this can damage that muscle – it’s commonly described as a heart attack; doctors may refer to it as “myocardial infarction.” Read more here:   Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, 24, is in critical condition after collapsing on the field on Monday night during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Here's what we know: What happened: Moments after getting up from an open field tackle on Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins, Hamlin fell on his back. Within 10 seconds, Bills team trainers were treating the player. An ambulance was brought onto the field in under five minutes, footage shows, and Hamlin received CPR, according to an ESPN broadcast. He was then taken to hospital. Hamlin's status: The player suffered a cardiac arrest following the hit from the tackle, and his heartbeat was restored on the field, the Bills said in a statement on Twitter early Tuesday. Hamlin was transferred to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for further testing and treatment, where he is now sedated, the Bills added. The game: Play was suspended at 5:58 of the first quarter, then the game was officially postponed. The NFL said more details on next steps would come at an "appropriate time," adding that Hamlin's wellbeing was the priority. The team: Some of Hamlin’s teammates stayed in Cincinnati while the rest of the team travels back to Buffalo Tuesday morning. Buffalo is in New York state, near the US-Canada border. Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs arrived at the hospital where Hamlin was being treated late Monday night, ESPN’s broadcast showed. A bit about Hamlin: The 24-year-old Pennsylvania native joined the Bills in 2021 as a sixth-round draft pick from the University of Pittsburgh. He has played every game this season. According to his Pittsburgh Panthers player bio, he was redshirted — meaning he sat out games while remaining on the team — in 2016 due to injury. The NFL site added that he also missed time due to injuries in 2017 and 2019. From CNN's Christian Edwards CNN Sports Anchor Coy Wire talked early Tuesday about the unsettling emotions last night’s events had sparked within him, given the similarities between his NFL career and Damar Hamlin’s. Wire played six seasons for the Bills between 2002 and 2007. “Seeing those images scratched open a lot of mental wounds for me personally. I played six of my NFL seasons there, in Buffalo, in that stadium. I played the same position. I played safety there. I’ve experienced injury, loss of consciousness … I’ve been in situations where an ambulance has come on the field, so it resonates,” Wire told CNN This Morning. Wire expressed his sympathies with Hamlin’s family and team, but also paused to praise the decision not to resume play after the tragic incident. Wire recalled two instances when former teammates of his – including former Bills player Kevin Everett – were paralyzed after suffering a trauma during the game. “In both of those games, ambulances came to the field, there were players huddled, there were tears, there was crying – just like we saw last night. But those games went on. The one last night did not. I think that’s a huge statement that’s being made.” Wire said he hopes that this “paradigm shift” continues, and begins to “echo down through the collegiate and high school and youth levels.” Tee Higgins, the Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver who Damar Hamlin tackled seconds before collapsing, has joined dozens of NFL players in publicly sending thoughts and prayers to the Buffalo Bills safety. "I’m praying that you pull through bro," Higgins tweeted after the game between the teams was postponed.  A number of Bills and Bengals players sent similar messages, after coming together on the field to pray as an ambulance carried Hamlin to hospital. "I wanna send a prayer to Damar and his family," Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase wrote. Bills quarterback Josh Allen added: "Please pray for our brother." Hamlin "is a kind caring extremely hard worker," Bills offensive lineman Rodger Saffold said. "He is loyal honest and can always put a smile on your face."   Teams and individuals around the league followed suit. "Heart is extremely heavy right now ... Life is too important. Cherish every moment," Rams quarterback Baker Mayfield wrote on Twitter. "Absolutely speechless.. please pull through Damar!" added Steelers outside linebacker TJ Watt. "This game should’ve been called, nobody is concerned about football right now," Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray wrote after the injury. The game was initially suspended, and then postponed, following the play on which Hamlin was hurt. Jessica Pegula, an American tennis player and the daughter of the Bills' owners, also commented on Hamlin after playing in the United Cup in Australia. “It's just terrible. There's really no words," Pegula told Reuters. "I'm glad they stopped the game. It brings you back to there's a lot of bigger things that are more important than sports and games. It was pretty scary." From CNN's Aya Elamroussi Damar Hamlin’s recovery could depend on how long he was in cardiac arrest after he collapsed mid-game Monday night, Dr. Anthony Cardillo, an emergency room specialist, told CNN early Tuesday morning. Hamlin was playing safety for the Buffalo Bills on Monday night when he suddenly collapsed after a tackle on Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. Hamlin stood up immediately after the tackle and then fell on his back seconds later. CPR was administered almost immediately after he collapsed, and medical personnel were able to revive his heartbeat while he was still at the field. The Bills later said he suffered a cardiac arrest and was in critical condition as of early Tuesday morning at a Cincinnati hospital. Cardiac arrest happens when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood to the body’s organs. “If you get hit at a very exact moment, it’s within milliseconds … that’s when you’re in cardiac arrest.” As Hamlin continued to receive treatment Tuesday, Cardillo explained that medical staff will likely slowly start weaning Hamlin off the ventilator over the next 12 to 24 hours to determine whether he can breathe on his own. CNN's Christian Edwards contributed reporting.  From CNN's Aya Elamroussi     Kelsey Conway, a reporter who covers the Bengals for the Cincinnati Enquirer, said the scene on the field was "horrifying" after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed Monday night. “It seemed to be very bad when they weren't moving,” Conway told CNN’s John Berman early Tuesday, referring to medical personnel who were attending to Hamlin. Conway said based on games she has covered, medical personnel try to move players off the field as quickly as possible. But that wasn’t the case with Hamlin as responders struggled to get him into the ambulance. As she sat in the stadium's press box, she could not determine what was happening to Hamlin as medical staff rushed to provide aid. Later, the Bills said Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest and remained in critical condition early Tuesday. Hamlin fell on his back Monday night just moments after standing up from an open field tackle on Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. Conway said the NFL’s Emergency Action Plan was activated in response to Hamlin’s collapse. The plan included an ambulance, a nearby highest Level 1 trauma center and airway traffic control, she said. “They never want things like this to happen, but they are prepared for situations like this. And they were able to get him to better care as quickly as they could,” Conway said. “He had a police escort take him in the ambulance. So, he got there pretty quickly.” Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.

      Funeral procession for PelÃ© begins after thousands, including Brazilâs president Lula da Silva, visited 24-hour wake
    
**************************
 
      A funeral procession which will take soccer great PelÃ© to his final resting place has begun Tuesday. 
   
      The procession started at the Urbano Caldeira Stadium, home of PelÃ©âs former club Santos, and his coffin will be carried through the streets of the city of Santos, including passing down the street where PelÃ©âs 100-year-old mother, Celeste Arantes, lives.
   
      It will continue to the Memorial NecrÃ³pole EcumÃªnica cemetery, where a private funeral will be held for family members.
   
      The three-time World Cup winner died on Thursday at the age of 82 from multiple organ failure due to the progression of colon cancer.
   
      Tributes from around the world have poured in ever since, with people of all ages flocking to his 24-hour public wake, which began on Monday at Santosâ 16,000-seater stadium, popularly known as âVila Belmiro.â
   
      More than 150,000 people, many were wearing Brazilâs iconic yellow jersey, had attended by Tuesday morning, according to Santos.
   
      The doors to the stadium closed with thousands of mourners still in line and people were turned away, according to CNN teams on the ground.
   
      Thousands have now lined the streets to watch the Brazilianâs coffin pass by. 
   
      Brazilian president Lula da Silva arrived at the wake on Tuesday morning with police security âvery muchâ reinforced to accommodate the Presidentâs presence, Santos told CNN.
   
      FIFA president Gianni Infantino traveled to Brazil to pay his respects on Monday.
   
      âPelÃ© is eternal,â Infantino told reporters, per Reuters. âFIFA will certainly honor the âkingâ as he deserves.
   
      
      PelÃ©'s final hurrah at New York Cosmos helped spark 'sporting revolution' across North America 
     
      âWe have asked all football associations in the world to pay a minute of silence before every game and will also ask them, 211 countries, to name a stadium after PelÃ©. Future generations must know and remember who PelÃ© was.â
   
      For more than 60 years, the name PelÃ© has been synonymous with football. He played in four World Cups and is the only player in history to win three, but his legacy stretched far beyond his trophy haul and remarkable goalscoring record.
   
      âI was born to play football, just like Beethoven was born to write music and Michelangelo was born to paint,â PelÃ© famously said.
   
      PelÃ©, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in history and Brazil held three days of national mourning following his death.

      Jeremy Renner is in ICU recovering from 2 surgeries after being injured in snow plowing incident
    
**************************
 
      âHawkeyeâ actor Jeremy Renner is recovering from surgery after suffering âblunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuriesâ in a New Yearâs Day snow plowing accident in Nevada, a spokesperson for the actor said.
   
      As of Monday evening, Renner was in the intensive care unit in âcritical but stable condition,â the spokesperson said.
   
      The 51-year-old actor has so far undergone two surgeries to address injuries he sustained in the accident, a source close to the actor previously told CNN.
   
      
      Jeremy Renner suffered 'blunt chest trauma,' required second surgery for 'extensive' injuries
     
      Renner was hospitalized on Sunday after a âweather related accidentâ while plowing snow, his representative Sam Mast confirmed to CNN earlier on Monday.
   
      The Washoe County Sheriffâs Office said its deputies responded to a âtraumatic injuryâ involving Renner in the area of Mount Rose Highway in Reno.
   
      Deputies found Renner injured and coordinated his transport to an area hospital, the Sheriffâs Office said in a news release, adding that the actor was the only person involved in the accident.
   
      The Sheriffâs Office did not provide details on how the snow plow accident happened but said its Major Accident Investigation Team is looking into the circumstances of the incident.
   
      At the time of the accident, parts of western Nevada were covered with snow. The Reno area received around 6-12 inches of snow at elevations below 5,000 feet between New Yearâs Eve and New Yearâs Day, and up to 18 inches at higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Reno.
   
      Renner has shared multiple videos and photos on his verified social media accounts showing him in snowy conditions, including one Instagram video posted two weeks ago in which the actor appears to be driving a snowplow.
   
      Rennerâs family released a statement Monday evening thanking hospital staff and first responders as the actor remained hospitalized.
   
      âJeremyâs family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible doctors and nurses looking after him, Truckee Meadows Fire and Rescue, Washoe County Sheriff, Reno City Mayor Hillary Schieve and the Carano and Murdock families,â a statement from his spokesperson read. âThey are also tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans.â 
   
      Renner stars in the Paramount+ series âMayor of Kingstownâ and is best known for his role as Hawkeye in several Marvel Cinematic Universe films.

      Australiaâs top health adviser urged government against restrictions on travelers from China
    
**************************
 
      Australiaâs top medical officer advised the government against imposing any restrictions on travelers coming from China, a day before the health minister announced new testing requirements, internal documents show.
   
      Chinaâs Covid cases are surging after Beijing abandoned its costly zero-Covid strategy, prompting a number of countries to impose restrictions on travelers coming from China and its territories.
   
      Australia was among them, though a letter published on the government website on Tuesday, written by the countryâs Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, reveals that the decision was made despite his advice that it wasnât necessary.
   
      âBased on available information, and in the absence of a specific threat from a variant with increased pathogenicity and immune escape, I do not believe that there is sufficient public health rationale to impose any restriction or additional requirements on travelers from China,â Kelly wrote in the letter dated December 31. 
   
      In the letter, Kelly acknowledged widespread concern about the limited information being released by China about its outbreak, âwhich has highlighted some gaps in global surveillance.â 
   
      However, he added that he had consulted with health officers from other parts of the country and New Zealand, and found a âstrong consensusâ that targeted travel restrictions would be âinconsistent with the current national approach to the management of Covid-19 and disproportionate to the risk.â
   
      
      Chinese tourists are ready to travel abroad again. Here's why some countries are hesitant
     
      Regardless, the following day Australian Health Minister Mark Butler announced that from Thursday, travelers coming from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao must show proof of a negative Covid test taken within 48 hours of their departure. At the time, he said the new measures were due to the âlack of comprehensive informationâ about Chinaâs Covid situation and genomic sequencing data.
   
      After criticism that the government was ignoring medical advice, Butler told local radio on Tuesday that it was acting âout of an abundance of caution,â and that the measures were limited to arrivals from China because, until recently, it was the only âsignificant countryâ in the world that hadnât opened up.
   
      Australia is among more than a dozen countries that have imposed restrictions on travelers from China and its territories in the past week. Most, including the US, UK, and other parts of Europe and Asia, are requiring either a pre-departure test or testing on arrival, with arrivals found positive needing to quarantine.
   
      Morocco took the extra step of outright banning all travelers from China, regardless of nationality. The ban goes into effect on Tuesday, with no information on when it will be lifted or whether it applies to people traveling from Hong Kong and Macao, Chinaâs two special administrative regions.
   
      The measures have been controversial, with health experts and scientists around the world warning that these targeted restrictions are largely ineffective at preventing the spread of Covid or new variants â and that they could instead stoke racism and xenophobia.
   
      On Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning warned that China would take countermeasures against the travel restrictions.
   
      âSome countries have adopted entry restrictions targeting only China, which lack scientific basis, and some excessive practices are even more unacceptable,â she said, adding: âWe are firmly opposed to attempts to manipulate epidemic prevention and control measures for political purposes, and will take corresponding countermeasures for different situations in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.â
   
      Several experts told CNN there is currently no evidence of a new variant emerging from China, and that even if one were to arise, it would likely spread across the world anyway. Testing requirements donât catch all cases, especially with variants that have a shorter incubation period.
   
      A countryâs best defense was to make sure its own population was well protected through domestic policy, such as widespread vaccinations and basic public health measures, said Karen Grepin, an associate professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong.
   
      âIn a lot of parts of the world, the pandemic feels like itâs over â¦ but at the end of the day, (these measures) are ultimately what prevents the transmission of the virus,â she said, adding that thereâs âno point in worrying about imported cases, if youâre not going to do anything about domestic cases.â
   
      âIf countries are at the point where they think those things are no longer important, because for example theyâve developed so much population immunity, then why care about a couple of new cases coming in from China?â
   
      In his letter, Kelly argued that Australiaâs domestic situation was strong enough to avoid imposing restrictions, pointing to the countryâs âstrong surveillance mechanismsâ and high immunity levels â due to both vaccination and previous infection. 
   
      Instead of travel restrictions, he proposed several alternative measures including an aircraft wastewater testing program and voluntary sampling of incoming travelers on arrival.

      Israelâs far-right Ben Gvir visits flashpoint Jerusalem holy site as Palestinians slam âprovocationâ
    
**************************
 
      Israelâs far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir  on Tuesday visited the Jerusalem compound known as the Temple Mount by Jews and the Haram al-Sharif or Noble Sanctuary by Muslims, in a move that drew condemnation from Palestinians and some Israelis. 
   
      Videos published on Israeli media showed Ben Gvir walking through the compound surrounded by Israeli police. 
   
      Tensions are high over the flashpoint complex, which is the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. It contains the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the site of the destroyed first and second Jewish Temples. Only Muslims are allowed to pray at the complex under a decades-old agreement; Ben Gvir believes that Jews should have the right to pray there too.
   
      Palestinians immediately objected to the visit.
   
      âWe strongly condemn extremist Ben Gvirâs storming of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and we consider it an unprecedented provocation and a serious threat,â the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. âWe hold [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu responsible for its consequences on the conflict and the region.â
   
      Ben Gvir entered the compound on Tuesday but not the Al-Aqsa Mosque building itself. The lawmakerâs visit was his first since he was sworn in last week as national security minister, in what is set to be the most right-wing government in Israelâs history. It is led by Netanyahu, who has returned for his sixth term as prime minister at the head of a coalition that includes several extremist parties. 
   
      
      Benjamin Netanyahu sworn in as leader of Israel's likely most right-wing government ever 
     
      Ben Gvir, the leader of the far-right Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) party, has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. As national security minister, he oversees police in Israel as well as some police activity in the occupied West Bank.
   
      Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, warned that Ben Gvirâs visit would be a âprecursor for the ignition of the regionâ and it will be âpouring fuel over fire.â
   
      âThe Israeli government of which I am a member will not surrender to a vile murdering organization,â Ben Gvir responded in a tweet. âThe Temple Mount is open to everyone and if Hamas thinks that if it threatens me it will deter me, let them understand that times have changed. There is a government in Jerusalem!â
   
      Under the so-called status quo agreement dating back to Ottoman rule of Jerusalem, only Muslims are allowed to pray inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and non-Muslims are only allowed to visit the complex at certain times. Israel and other states agreed to maintain status quo access to these holy sites after Israel captured them in the 1967 war.
   
      Some religious nationalist Jewish groups have been demanding access to the Temple Mount area for Jewish prayer. There have been several instances of Jewish visitors conducting prayers on the compound, sparking outrage from Muslim authorities and forced removals by Israeli police.
   
      Former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid criticized Netanyahu over the visit, calling him âweakâ for entrusting the âmost irresponsible man in the Middle East to the most explosive place in the Middle East.â  
   
      In a tweet, Lapid called the visit a âprovocation that will lead to violence that will endanger human life and cost human lives,â and said that itâs time for Netanyahu to tell Ben Gvir, âyou donât go up to the Temple Mount because people will die.â 
   
      Jordan condemned Ben Gvirâs visit in the âstrongestâ terms, calling it âa flagrant and unacceptable violation of international law, and of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities.â  
   
      Jordanâs monarchy has been the custodian of Jerusalemâs holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of Muslims and Christians in the city.
   
      Visits by Israeli political figures have historically preceded periods of violence between Israel and Palestinians. The conservative Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharonâs visit to the complex in September 2000 contributed to the start of the Second Intifada, a yearslong Palestinian uprising against Israel

      McCarthy faces make-or-break moment in vote to elect House speaker
    
**************************
 
      House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy faces a make-or-break moment on Tuesday, as he seeks to lock down the support necessary to become the next speaker in a vote that could turn into a chaotic and contentious once-in-a-century floor fight. 
   
      The 118th Congress is set to convene to elect a new speaker, but McCarthy does not yet have the votes to secure the gavel â a major problem for the California Republican that threatens to tear apart the incoming House GOP majority. If McCarthy fails to shore up the support he needs to win in the initial round of voting, the race for speaker could go to multiple ballots â something that hasnât happened since 1923. 
   
      LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the new Congress and House speaker vote 
   
      McCarthy faces a small but determined contingent of hardline conservatives. The group is using the leverage they have in the razor-thin Republican majority to extract concessions as they threaten to deny the GOP leader critical votes. McCarthy has already given in to a number of their demands, including making it easier to topple the sitting speaker, but it is unclear whether his efforts will be enough.
   
      Though McCarthy has made clear he has no plans to drop out of the race even if it goes to multiple ballots on the floor, the fight has cast a long shadow over the incoming House Republican majority. And the deal-making McCarthy has engaged in to try to win over critics may mean he has a weaker hand to play in his position of authority if he does become speaker. 
   
      Sources with knowledge of McCarthyâs thinking say he is still confident that he will get the 218 votes to be elected. But there is no way of guessing how long the voting will go or how many ballots it will take.
   
      To be elected speaker, a candidate needs to win a majority of members who vote for a specific person on the House floor. That amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes âpresent.â
   
      House Republicans will hold 222 seats in the new Congress â so for McCarthy to reach 218 votes, he would only be able to afford to lose four GOP votes. So far, at least five Republicans have vowed to oppose him, with nearly a dozen other GOP lawmakers publicly saying theyâre still not there yet.
   
      The potential for the election to advance to multiple ballots has raised the question of whether a viable alternative could emerge if McCarthy canât get the votes. The GOP leaderâs allies and foes alike have attempted to quietly game out what could happen if he fails to secure the gavel on the first round and lawmakers move into uncharted territory. 
   
      McCarthy is facing a longshot challenge in the race from hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs. McCarthy has defeated the Arizona congressman before â by a resounding vote of 188 to 31 in November when the House Republican conference voted for McCarthy to be its leader. But the longshot challenge has still complicated McCarthyâs effort to become speaker and threatens to draw support away from the GOP leader in the critical vote.
   
      
      Why the right has already won the House speakership election
     
      After the far-right House Freedom Caucus denied his ascension to the speakership in 2015, McCarthy spent years courting the conservative wing of his party and worked hard to stay in former President Donald Trumpâs good graces. 
   
      McCarthy has gotten some key backup from Trump, who publicly endorsed his speaker bid and encouraged others to support McCarthy. His congressional allies have also banded together in effort to act as a counterweight to his critics. 
   
      But when a red wave never materialized in the November midterms, the razor-thin majority that resulted for Republicans empowered a small band of conservatives â long distrustful of McCarthy â to make demands.
   
      What has unfolded over the last two months is an all-out scramble for the speakership, which has taken the form of strategy sessions with close allies on and off Capitol Hill, intense negotiations over rules changes and non-stop phone calls with members.
   
      McCarthy has been in deal-making mode, but if he does win the gavel, some of the concessions he has made may make it more difficult for him to stave off future challenge to his speakership.
   
      In one change that could weaken his hand in the future, McCarthy has told lawmakers â as first reported by CNN â that he would support a threshold as low as five Republicans to trigger a vote on deposing the speaker, known as the âmotion to vacateâ the speakerâs chair, a major concession for him and one that moderates worry will be used as a constant cudgel over his head.

      FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to appear in court Tuesday

      Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is set to appear in person in a Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to face charges that include cheating investors out of billions of dollars.
   
      Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, is charged with eight criminal counts ranging from wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, to conspiracy by misusing customer funds. He is expected to plead not guilty and could face up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all charges.
   
      Last month, a US judge released him on a $250 million bond in his first appearance on American soil since his arrest in the Bahamas, where he lived and ran his businesses. The judge agreed to a bail package proposed by federal prosecutors and lawyers for Bankman-Fried that also requires the former so-called âcrypto kingâ to wear an electronic ankle monitor and remain under house arrest at his parentsâ home in Palo Alto, California. 
   
      Prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried orchestrated âone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,â stealing billions of dollars from FTX customers to cover losses at its sister hedge fund, Alameda Research.
   
      FTX and Alameda both filed for bankruptcy in December after investors rushed to pull their deposits from the exchange, sparking a liquidity crisis and triggering contagion and panic across the crypto industry.
   
      Two senior executives associated with the collapse â Gary Wang, the co-founder of FTX, and Caroline Ellison, who served as Alamedaâs CEO â have since pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges and are cooperating with federal prosecutors, according to unsealed court records. In addition, the pair face civil fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   
      Wang faces up to 50 years in prison in accordance with federal sentencing guidelines referenced in court. Ellison faces up to 110 years in prison for the seven criminal counts sheâs pleaded guilty to, per federal sentencing guidelines.
   
      FTXâs new CEO, John Ray, who made his name overseeing the liquidation of Enron in the early 2000s, said in a congressional hearing that customer funds deposited on the FTX site were commingled with funds at Alameda, which made a number of speculative, high-risk bets. 
   
      Ray described the situation at the two companies as âold-fashioned embezzlementâ at the hands of a small group of âgrossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals.â

      Idaho killings suspect is expected to waive extradition at Tuesday hearing
    
**************************
 
      The suspect in the November slaying of four University of Idaho students may soon be in Idaho to face first-degree murder charges if â as expected â he doesnât challenge his extradition to the Gem State in a Tuesday hearing in Pennsylvania.
   
      Bryan Kohbergerâs state-appointed attorney has indicated his client plans to waive extradition from his home state and has called the hearing a âformality proceeding.â 
   
      All the commonwealth needs to prove is that his client resembles or is the person on the arrest warrant and that he was in the area at the time of the crimes, Monroe County Chief Public Defender Jason LaBar told CNNâs Jean Casarez.
   
      
      What we still don't know about the suspect in the Idaho college student killings
     
      Kohberger was arrested Friday in Pennsylvania, almost seven weeks after Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, were found dead November 13 in an off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho. 
   
      Kohberger was âshocked a little bit,â LaBar told CNN a day after his client was arrested. Kohberger is presumed innocent until proven guilty, LaBar added in a statement. He âbelieves heâs going to be exonerated.â LaBar said in an interview on NBCâs âTodayâ show Tuesday.
   
      Kohberger has been âvery easy to talk to,â is âin a calm demeanorâ and understands the proceedings, including what to expect concerning his transport to Idaho and what to expect when he gets there, LaBar said.
   
      The 28-year-old suspect last month finished his first semester as a PhD student in the criminal justice program at Washington State Universityâs campus in Pullman, about a 15-minute drive west of Moscow.
   
      
      Suspect in the Idaho college student killings returned home for the holidays weeks after the crime. Here's what we know about him
     
      He drove home to Pennsylvania for the holidays, accompanied by his father, LaBar told CNN on Saturday. The two arrived in the commonwealth around December 17. 
   
      A white Hyundai Elantra authorities had been looking for in connection with the killings was found at Kohbergerâs parentsâ house, LaBar confirmed.
   
      Investigators focused on Kohberger as a suspect after tracing ownership of the Elantra, which had been seen in the area of the killings, to him, according to two law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation. Also, his DNA was matched to genetic material recovered at the home where the students were slain, the two sources said.
   
      An FBI surveillance team tracked Kohberger for four days before his arrest while law enforcement worked with prosecutors to develop enough probable cause to get a warrant, the two law enforcement sources said.
   
      Other than the DNA and the car, details such as whether Kohberger knew the victims â or a possible motive in the slayings â are not publicly known. The probable-cause affidavit, which would contain information to justify the suspectâs arrest, remains sealed until he appears in an Idaho court. 
   
      With those details still unknown, much public interest has focused on Kohbergerâs criminal justice studies. 
   
      He graduated with a bachelorâs degree in 2020 and this year completed his Master of Arts in criminal justice at DeSales University in Pennsylvania, according to a spokesperson for the university.
   
      In a post removed from Reddit after his arrest was announced, a student investigator associated with a DeSales University study named Bryan Kohberger sought participants for a research project âto understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision-making when committing a crime.â
   
      âIn particular, this study seeks to understand the story behind your most recent criminal offense, with an emphasis on your thoughts and feelings throughout your experience,â the post read.
   
      Moscow Police Department Chief James Fry said after the arrest that the investigation of the complex, extensive case was not over. 
   
      Investigators are still searching for pieces of evidence, Fry said, including the weapon used, believed to be a fixed-blade knife.
   
      âWe developed a clear picture over time,â he said, â(but) be assured that the work is not done. This is just started.â
   
      Kohberger is being held without bail in Pennsylvania, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said Friday. Once Kohberger is in Idaho, he is expected to make an initial appearance before a magistrate, and further hearings will be scheduled.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/03/health/cardiac-arrest-heart-attack-heart-failure-explainer-wellness/index.html

      What are cardiac arrest, heart attack and heart failure?
    
**************************
 
      Heart disease is a leading killer around the world and the top cause of death in the United States. It killed an estimated 17.9 million people in 2019, representing 32% of all deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization.
   
      But not all heart disease is the same. It can affect the blood vessels to the heart or brain, heart muscles and valves, and other areas of the body. Cardiovascular diseases can require long-term treatment, or they can come on suddenly and seriously.
   
      Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, 24, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday nightâs game between the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals, his team said. Itâs not clear what caused his cardiac arrest.
   
      Cardiac arrest results from electrical disturbances that cause the heart to suddenly stop beating properly.
   
      In cardiac arrest, death can result quickly if steps arenât taken immediately. âCardiac arrest may be reversed if CPR is performed and a defibrillator shocks the heart and restores a normal heart rhythm within a few minutes,â according to the American Heart Association.
   
      
      Bills player Damar Hamlin is in critical condition after collapsing from a cardiac arrest on the field, team says
     
      More than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the United States each year, the AHA said.
   
      A sudden, unexpected loss of heart function also results in a sudden loss of breathing and consciousness.
   
      Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack, although almost any known heart condition, including heart attack, can cause cardiac arrest.
   
      Another emergency that can lead to cardiac arrest, commotio cordis, is a disruption of heart rhythm after a blow to the area directly over the heart at a key time during a heartbeat cycle. 
   
      Itâs rare, but it mostly occurs in boys and young men during sports. The American Heart Association says itâs the leading cause of deaths in youth baseball in the United States, typically two to three per year. Automated external defibrillators have helped increase the survival rate.
   
      Unlike cardiac arrest, a heart attack is a circulation problem. When circulation is blocked or cut off in some way and blood is no longer supplied to the heart muscle, this can damage that muscle â itâs commonly described as a heart attack; doctors may refer to it as âmyocardial infarction.â
   
      
      Sleep duration matters for heart health, according to new recommendations
     
      Blockages causing heart attacks are mostly caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries. Plaque forms when cholesterol combines with fat, calcium and other substances in the blood. 
   
      Combined, these elements harden into plaque, which can then rupture, causing a blood clot to form. Large clots can completely block the flow of blood through an artery. 
   
      âPeople who are at risk for heart attacks are people who have a family history of heart attack, having high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of exercise, cigarette smoking â the major risk factors we always discuss,â Dr. Nieca Goldberg, medical director of Atria New York City and clinical associate professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, previously told CNN.
   
      
      Task force's updated guidelines do not recommend daily aspirin for heart health for most adults
     
      Another less frequent cause of a heart attack is a spasm caused by tobacco or possibly illicit drugs, such as cocaine, which disables the heart muscle, according to the American Heart Association. A tear in the artery, though rare, can also result in a heart attack.
   
      Heart attacks can be fatal, but they do not automatically lead to death. Immediate emergency medical help can often prevent a serious outcome.
   
      âIf you think someone is having an heart attack, call 911. Donât wait,â Goldberg said, explaining that the reason itâs important to take an ambulance to the hospital instead of catching a ride with a family member or friend. An ambulance is equipped to offer treatment on the way to the hospital.
   
      Common warning signs of a heart attack are discomfort or pain in the chest; discomfort in other areas of the upper body, including pain in in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach; and shortness of breath. Other possible signs include cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.
   
      Overall, heart attacks are more common than cardiac arrest in the United States. 
   
      Heart failure is condition that occurs when the heart, essentially a pump, cannot effectively push blood out through the arteries and circulatory system to the bodyâs other organs and tissues. 
   
      
      Don't bother with dietary supplements for heart health, study says
     
      Congestive heart failure, a worsening of this general condition, means blood flow from the heart through the arteries has slowed while blood returning to the heart through the veins has begun to back up and combined they cause congestion â a blood traffic jam â in the bodyâs tissues. 
   
      The result is edema, or swelling, usually in the legs and ankles, though edema can happen anywhere in the body. Heart failure also impairs the kidneysâ ability to dispose of water and sodium, causing even more swelling. When pulmonary edema happens, fluid collects in the lungs and interferes with breathing.
   
    Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
   
      Conditions that can lead to heart failure include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and coronary artery disease: when plaque builds up in the walls of arteries causing them to narrow and increasing the difficulty of pumping blood. 
   
      Heart failure is a medical condition that needs to be treated to prevent a life-threatening heart attack, but is not as immediately life threatening as heart attack or cardiac arrest.

      UK train strikes will disrupt return to work this week

      Brits are facing another week of travel chaos as rail strikes drag into the new year, disrupting the return to workplaces following the holidays and dealing another blow to retail and hospitality businesses.
   
      Some 40,000 rail workers began five days of strike action over pay on Tuesday, shutting down rail services across the United Kingdom and continuing months of unrest that blighted travel for much of last year. 
   
      Britainâs largest transport union, RMT, said workers will strike on January 3, 4, 6 and 7. ASLEF, the train driversâ union, will also walk out on January 5.
   
      
      Britons urged to avoid risky activity as paramedics join strikes. How did things get so bad?
     
      Passengers should travel only if âabsolutely necessary,â according to the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for train operating companies and Network Rail, owner of Britainâs rail infrastructure. It said that around half of the rail network will shut down on strike days, with only about 20% of normal services running. 
   
      The travel chaos will delay the return to offices following the holidays, a disappointing start to the year for stores and restaurants hoping for a new year bump to sales after earlier rail strikes hurt Christmas trading.
   
      UKHospitality, an industry group, estimates this weekâs strikes will cost pubs, restaurants, hotels and other venues about Â£200 million ($239 million) in lost sales. Thatâs on top of âvital-pre Christmas salesâ losses of Â£1.5 billion ($1.8 billion) in December, according to CEO Kate Nicholls.
   
      The rail strikes will make city centers âghost townsâ for another week, Nicholls said.
   
      âThe sector has struggled to recover from Covid and these protracted rail strikes since May have made that bounce back much tougher,â she added.
   
      Strikes have swept across the United Kingdom over the past year, as workers grapple with a cost-of-living crisis. Wages have stagnated and failed to keep pace with inflation, which reached a four-decade high of 11.1% in October and remains elevated, at 10.7%.
   
      Thatâs sparked disputes with employers, leading to strikes encompassing railways, schools, hospitals, and the postal service. Nurses and ambulance workers are set to take further industrial action later this month. 
   
      According to PwC, the average British workerâs pay in 2023 is expected to fall back to 2006 levels once inflation is taken into account. Real wages, which factor in inflation, are expected to have fallen by as much as 3% in 2022, and could drop another 2% in 2023, PwC predicted last month in a report shared with CNN.
   
      RMT claimed Monday that the UK government was blocking its attempts to resolve the disagreement over pay.
   
      
      UK wages next year will be at their lowest level since 2006, report says
     
      âWe will continue our industrial action campaign while we work towards a negotiated resolution,â the unionâs general secretary Mick Lynch said in a statement.
   
      Mick Whelan, general secretary of ASLEF, said its members have not had a pay rise for nearly four years. âWe donât want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,â he added.
   
      A spokesperson for the Department of Transport said the government âstands ready to facilitate a resolution to rail disputes.â 
   
      âItâs time the unions came to the table and played their part as well,â the spokesperson added.
   
      In a statement, Network Rail said that the RMT strike was âunnecessary and deeply damagingâ to the railway and the economy. 
   
      The company added that two of three unions had already accepted a pay increase worth over 9% and it urged RMT to reconsider âthe best deal put before any railways trade union for decades.â
   
      âWe hope to get back round the table once this weekâs strikes are over,â it added.

      Rescuers try to save boy, 10, trapped in concrete pile
    
**************************
 
      Rescuers in Vietnam were desperately trying to free a 10-year boy on Monday two days after he fell into the narrow open shaft of a concrete pile at a construction site on New Yearâs Eve.
   
      Ly Hao Nam was heard crying for help shortly after he fell into the pile on Saturday morning, but rescuers received no response from him on Monday as they lowered a camera down to try to locate his position in the 35-meter (115-feet) long support pillar.
   
      The calamity occurred at a bridge construction site in the Mekong Delta region where the boy had been searching with friends for scrap iron.
   
      âI cannot understand how he fell into the hollow concrete pile, which has a diameter of a (25-centimeter/10-inch) span only, and was driven 35 meters into the ground,â Le Hoang Bao, director of Dong Thap provinceâs Department of Transport, told Tuoi Tre News, a local newspaper.
   
      Efforts to lift the pile with cranes and excavators had so far failed and rescuers were unable to determine the boyâs position, media reported.
   
      Rescuers have pumped oxygen into the pile and have softened the soil around it but the pile has tilted slightly, complicating extraction efforts.

      Rally driver and YouTube star Ken Block dies in snowmobile accident aged 55
    
**************************
 
      Professional rally driver and YouTube star Ken Block died in a snowmobile accident on Monday, his Hoonigan Racing team announced. He was 55.
   
      âKen was a visionary, a pioneer and an icon. And most importantly, a father and husband,â Hoonigan Racing said in a statement. âHe will be incredibly missed. Please respect the familyâs privacy at this time while they grieve.â
   
      The accident occurred at 2 p.m. when Block was riding a snowmobile down a steep slope in Wasatch County, Utah, according to the Wasatch County Sheriffâs Office.
   
      The snowmobile upended and landed on top of Block, the Sheriffâs Office said, and he was later pronounced dead at the scene from injuries sustained in the accident.
   
      âMr. Block was riding with a group but was alone when the accident occurred,â a statement from the Sherriffâs Office said.
   
      âThe State Medical Examinerâs Office will determine the official cause of death. We are saddened to hear of the loss of Kenneth and our hearts are with his family and friends so deeply affected.
   
      âWe thank all of our first responders for their continued service.â
   
      Before embarking on his rally driving career, Block co-founded sportswear company DC Shoes in 1994, which went on to become one of the most recognizable skateboarding apparel brands in the world.
   
      He began rallying in 2005 and two years later made his debut on the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) circuit in Mexico. He started 25 WRC events and won five X Games medals in RallyCross between 2006 and 2015.
   
      âShocked and saddened to hear the passing of a true icon of our sport,â said Belgian rally driver Thierry Neuville. âA passionate racer and real pioneer that inspired so many of us. Rest in peace buddy. All my sympathies are with the family and friends.â
   
      Block also gained fame for the Gymkhana YouTube series in which he performed driving stunts and drifts at different locations in the United States and around the world. The videos proved hugely popular and gained hundreds of millions of views.
   
      âIn shock at the passing of Ken Block. Such a talent that did so much for our sport,â ex-Formula One driver Jenson Button wrote on Twitter.
   
      âHe was a true visionary with his own unique style & infectious smile. Our sport lost one of the best today but more importantly a great man.â
   
      Block is survived by his wife, Lucy, and three children.

      Worldâs largest iPhone factory bounces back from Covid disruption that hurt Apple

            Latest Market News 
	

 
      Production at the worldâs biggest iPhone factory, disrupted since October by Chinaâs Covid-19 restrictions and worker protests, is now running at nearly full capacity, according to a Chinese state media report.
   
      The sprawling campus in central China, owned by Apple
            
                (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, was running at 90% of planned production capacity at the end of December, the Henan Daily newspaper reported Tuesday. It cited an interview with Wang Xue, deputy general manager of the facility, which is also known as iPhone city.
   
      âAt the moment, the order books look good, and the orders will peak from now until a few months after Chinese New Year,â he was quoted as saying. The Lunar New Year will begin on January 22.
   
      Foxconn hasnât yet responded to CNNâs request for comment about the report. 
   
      The company said last month it was working on restoring production, which had been badly affected by supply disruptions caused by Covid restrictions. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives estimated in November that the disruptions in Zhengzhou had been costing Apple roughly $1 billion a week in lost iPhone sales.
   
      According to a UBS report in November, the wait time for the latest 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max in the United States touched 34 days just before the Christmas holidays because of supply chain constraints in China. The UBS analyst called the wait time âextreme.â 
   
      The Henan Daily separately quoted an executive responsible for Foxconnâs logistics as saying that, in the first two days of January, the volume of inbound and outbound shipments had reached the highest level in a year. 
   
      The report of a nearly full resumption of production comes one month after China abruptly ended three years of pandemic controls, setting off a huge wave of Covid infections.
   
      According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, a letter from Foxconn founder Terry Gou played a major role in persuading Chinese leaders to accelerate plans to dismantle the countryâs Covid-19 policies. Gou was quoted as warning that strict Covid controls would threaten Chinaâs central position in global supply chains.
   
      Gouâs office told CNN that it âdenies the report and its contents.â
   
      Wang was quoted by the Henan Daily as saying iPhone City currently had about 200,000 workers on site. The employees were each eligible for a maximum of 13,000 yuan ($1,883) per month in bonuses, he said, without specifying their base salaries.  
   
      The troubles for Foxconn started in October when workers left the campus, located in the central Chinese province of Henan, because of concerns about Covid-related working conditions and shortages of food. Short on staff, bonuses were offered to workers to return.
   
      But violent protests broke out in November when the newly-hired staff said management reneged on their promises. Workers clashed with security officers, before the company eventually offered them cash to quit and leave the site.
   
      Analysts said the production woes at iPhone City would speed up the pace of Appleâs supply chain diversification away from China.

      Look up to see Januaryâs first celestial event, the Quadrantid meteor shower
    
**************************
 
  Sign up for CNNâs Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
 
      The new year kicks off with the Quadrantids, one of 12 annual meteor showers.
   
      The celestial event is typically among the strongest meteor showers and is expected to peak overnight January 3 and 4, according to the American Meteor Society. Sky-gazers in the Northern Hemisphere can best view the shower between the late-night hours of Tuesday and dawn on Wednesday.
   
      However, the shower is notoriously hard to observe due to its brief peak of six hours and Januaryâs often inclement weather in the Northern Hemisphere. A bright, nearly full moon will make the Quadrantids even less visible this year. 
   
      Moonset will occur just before dawn, providing a very small window to spot the shower against dark skies.
   
      Predictions for the showerâs peak range from 10:40 p.m. to 1:40 a.m. ET (3:40 a.m. to 6:40 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time). The later time favors those in the eastern part of North America and the earlier time is more favorable for observers across Europe. The Quadrantids wonât be visible in the Southern Hemisphere because the showerâs radiant point doesnât rise that high in its sky before dawn.
   
      Check Time and Dateâs site to see what your chances are like to view the event, or step outside to take a look for yourself. The Virtual Telescope Project will also have a live stream of the shower over Rome. 
   
      Between 50 and 100 meteors are typically visible per hour, especially in rural areas, although the peak can include up to 120 visible meteors in an hour. 
   
      Watch the northeastern sky, and look about halfway up. You may even glimpse some fireballs during the meteor shower. View the skies for at least an hour, the American Meteor Society advises.
   
      If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isnât full of bright city lights. If youâre able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from late evening until dawn. 
   
      Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness â without looking at your phone â so the meteors will be easier to spot.

      If the meteor showerâs name sounds odd, itâs probably because it doesnât sound like itâs related to a constellation, like other meteor showers. Thatâs because the Quadrantidsâ namesake constellation no longer exists â at least, not as a recognized constellation.
   
      The constellation Quadrans Muralis, first observed and noted in 1795 between BoÃ¶tes and Draco, is no longer included in the International Astronomical Unionâs list of modern constellations because itâs considered obsolete and isnât used as a landmark for celestial navigation anymore, according to EarthSky.
   
      Like the Geminid meteor shower, the Quadrantid comes from a mysterious asteroid or ârock comet,â rather than an icy comet, which is unusual. This particular asteroid is 2003 EH1, which takes 5.52 years to complete one orbit around the sun. The showerâs peak is short because only a small stream of particles interacts with our atmosphere, and the stream occurs at a perpendicular angle. Each year, Earth passes through this debris trail for a short time.
   
      In addition to the meteor shower, a recently discovered comet will soon make its appearance in Januaryâs night sky.
   
      Discovered in March 2022, the comet will make its closest approach to the sun on January 12, according to NASA. The comet, spotted by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, is named C/2022 E3 (ZTF) and will make its closest pass of Earth on February 2.
   
      The comet should be visible through binoculars in the morning sky for sky-watchers in the Northern Hemisphere during most of January and those in the Southern Hemisphere in early February, according to NASA.

      Here are the rest of 2023âs top sky events, so you can have your binoculars and telescope ready. 
   
      Mark your calendar with the peak dates of other showers to watch in 2023:
   
      Most years, there are 12 full moons â one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two occurring in August. 
   
      The second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase âonce in a blue moon,â according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases donât always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2.5 years.
   
      
      10 moments in 2022 straight out of a sci-fi movie
     
      The two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky. 
   
      Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee â its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.
   
      Here is the list of full moons for 2023, according to the Farmerâs Almanac: 
   
      While these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moon, each one carries its own significance across Native American tribes (with many also referred to by differing names).
   
      There will be two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses in 2023.
   
      A total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun. 
   
      And for some sky-watchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will actually be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earthâs surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moonâs shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA. 
   
      Like a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth during an annular eclipse â but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesnât completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.
   
      A Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across the Americas. 
   
      
      2022's extraordinary cosmic revelations and moments in space exploration
     
      Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sunâs light can be damaging to the eye.
   
      Meanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earthâs shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.
   
      When the full moon moves into Earthâs shadow, it darkens, but it wonât disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earthâs atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red â which is why the event is often referred to as a âblood moon.â
   
      Depending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through the atmosphere and casts it on the moon.
   
      A penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earthâs shadow.  
   
      A partial lunar eclipse of the hunterâs moon on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon donât completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.

      Number of young children who accidentally ate cannabis edibles jumped 1,375% in five years, study finds
    
**************************
 
      In just five years, the number of small children in the US exposed to cannabis after accidentally eating an edible rose 1,375%, a new study says.
   
      There were more than 7,040 exposures to edible cannabis in kids under 6 between 2017 and 2021, according to an analysis of records from the National Poison Data System, a central repository for data from Americaâs Poison Centers. 
   
      
      The bags look like well-known chips or candies, but what's inside could harm children
     
      In 2017, there were 207 reported cases of accidental edible cannabis exposure among kids under the age of 6. By 2021, there were 3,054, the study found. 
   
      In 2020 alone, young kidsâ accidental exposures to cannabis accounted for more than 40% of all human poison exposure calls to these centers, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics. 
   
      âHonestly, we knew it was increasing. I work in the [emergency department] as well as taking calls for the poison center, and so even though I was seeing more cases coming through the ER, when we looked at the data nationwide, we were definitely surprised,â said study co-author Dr. Antonia Nemanich, who works in emergency medicine and medical toxicology at Rush Emergency Medicine in Chicago.  
   
      The researchers couldnât get at exactly why there was such a significant increase, but Nemanich thinks it is âmultifactoral.â
   
      
      Children are at increased risk of accidental poisoning from marijuana edibles, study finds
     
      âThere was a particular spike during the pandemic years,â she said, when children were home more often. 
   
      A 2022 study showed that people in US states that legalized recreational cannabis use it 20% more frequently than in states that didnât legalize it. 
   
      In 2017, just eight states and the District of Columbia allowed recreational cannabis use, and 30 allowed it for medicinal purposes. By 2021, those numbers had grown significantly to 19 and 40, respectively. 
   
      With increased legalization, there may also be more products available overall.
   
      âI think all of that plays into this, and the regulations havenât kept pace with the increased prevalence of the product,â Nemanich said.
   
      Many edibles come in the form of candies, cookies, brownies and chocolates, products that can have a strong toddler appeal. 
   
      Research has found that the packaging of some edible products, especially those available on the black market, looks nearly identical to the real thing. There are knockoff Doritos, Cheetos, Nerds Rope and Gushers candy, for example. Large food companies have sued many of the companies selling these products, but theyâre still available. 
   
      Some packages also have child-friendly cartoon characters. 
   
      Even if the packaging warns that the product contains cannabis or THC, itâs often in small print, and many young children canât read in the first place. 
   
      
      Vaping marijuana by teens doubles in last seven years, with potentially harmful consequences, study says
     
      A childâs exposure to cannabis can have serious consequences. They can become very sick and have problems walking, sitting or breathing, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
      Many of the outcomes in the study were unclear, but in nearly a quarter of the cases, the toddlers were admitted to the hospital. There was a significant increase in both intensive care and non-intensive care admissions. 
   
      That could be for a few reasons. Kids weigh less than adults, so a drugâs impact can be much more toxic. Additionally, packages usually come with more than one edible in them; adults know to stop after eating just one, but children donât, the study said.  
   
      There was also an increase in the severity of toxicity in the pandemic years, compared with before, the study found.
   
      
      Tricks, treats and THC fears in Colorado
     
      Common problems included heart problems, confusion, vomiting and trouble breathing, the study says.
   
      âIt is important for providers to be aware of this in their practice and it presents an important opportunity for education and prevention,â the study says.
   
      The CDC recommends that people keep all weed products out of the reach of children in childproof containers. 
   
      The American College of Medical Toxicology has urged the industry to change its packaging so kids donât get so easily confused and canât open the packages as easily. The association also suggests that people should not use cannabis products in front of children.
   
      Nemanich says edible cannabis products should come in plain, neutral, opaque white packaging. 
   
      âMy stance is that it is not a problem that these products are legalized, but the problem is that theyâre not packaged the way drugs or medications are packaged. We have a lot of safeguards in place for that,â she said. âTheyâre marketed as if theyâre just any other tasty treat.â 
   
    Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
   
      She hopes the study will spur change.   
   
      âWe wanted to catch this population of kids that are getting into this stuff unintentionally,â Nemanich said. âWe know theyâre not seeking it out as a mind-altering substance. We knew subjectively they were at high risk because weâd see a lot of exposures in the ER, and theyâre very likely to just put something in their mouth that looks tasty.â

      Mediterranean style of eating named best diet for 2023
    
**************************
 
      The gold medals are piling up. For the sixth year in a row, the Mediterranean style of eating earned the title of best overall diet, according to 2023 ratings announced Tuesday by U.S. News & World Report. Meals from the sunny Mediterranean also ranked first in the categories of diet best diet for healthy eating and best plant-based diet, the report said.
   
      
      8 myths about diet, exercise and sleep 
     
      In two new categories added for 2023, the Mediterranean tied with the cholesterol-lowering TLC (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes) and flexitarian diets as best family-friendly diet, and with DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) for best bone and joint health diet.
   
      âWeâre always looking for more health conditions that we can address. But often thereâs not enough scientific data examining diet X and condition X,â said Gretel Schueller, managing editor of health for U.S. News & World Report, who oversees the annual diet ranking.
   
      âHowever, bone and joint health is an area where thereâs a fair amount of scientific literature,â Schueller said. âWe also recognize our population is aging so focusing on diets that can increase the quality of life among older individuals is an important element.â
   
      Also new this year: Reviewers only ranked 24 diets instead of the 40 or so diets analyzed in past years. Five diets from the original list â vegetarian, vegan, Nordic, the traditional Asian and the glycemic index â were integrated by judges into the Mediterranean and other diets due to their  underlying plant-based principles.
   
      âThe take-home message here is the recognition that the Mediterranean diet is really not just about the foods around the Mediterranean,â Schueller said. âYou can take the the lessons and the approach of the Mediterranean eating pattern and apply it to any cuisine in any country.â
   
      That approach is reflected within two new diets â Keyto and Pritikin â that were added to the review for 2023, Schueller said. (Yes. thatâs Keyto with a Y.)
   
      âWe recognize that more and more people are eating sort of a plant-forward or plant-based diet or at least trying to,â she said. âThe keto with a Y diet is supposed to be a flexible, low-carb Mediterranean plan.
   
      âThe Pritikin diet focuses on low-fat, high-fiber eating of whole foods, and is fairly flexible,â she added. âWe are seeing a push towards eating more whole, unprocessed foods, which I think is a great thing.â
   
      Numerous studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life. 
   
      
      How to stock your kitchen with Mediterranean grocery staples
     
      The diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions. 
   
      Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.
   
      Social interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.
   
      Just as they did in 2022, the DASH and the flexitarian diet tied for second place in best overall diet. Similar to the Mediterranean style of eating, these diets reduce or eliminate processed foods and stress packing your plate with fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds. 
   
      The DASH diet emphasizes limiting salt intake in its goal to reduce blood pressure, while the flexitarian diet, true to its name, allows an occasional indulgence of meat or poultry. 
   
      A panel of 33 experts examined top diets and ranked them in several categories: Did the diet include all food groups; was it evidence based; are needed foods available at any supermarket; how easy is the diet to prepare, and did it use additional vitamins or supplements.
   
      âWe focused on quality over quantity,â Schueller said. âOur reviewers felt there are some diets out there that are so wacky theyâre not worth giving time to, such as the Dukan diet, which we no longer rank.â 
   
      The worst diet award went to the raw foods diet this year, at least in part due to the lack of nutritional completeness, which has raised safety concerns among the reviewers. Because followers can only eat unprocessed foods that havenât been cooked, microwaved, irradiated, genetically engineered or exposed to pesticides or herbicides, reviews consider the diet almost impossible to follow.
   
      
      Diet showdown: Keto versus Mediterranean. Which won?
     
      The popular keto diet, along with the modified keto, was ranked 20 out of the 24 diets, followed by Atkins, SlimFast and Optavia. These diets emphasize eating high-protein or high-fat foods with minimal carbohydrates and receive low rankings because they are extremely restrictive, hard to follow and eliminate entire food groups.
   
      Despite ketoâs low overall rating, reviewers gave the keto diet first place for best short-term weight loss diet, Schueller said, quickly adding that these diets are not considered healthy as a lifestyle.
   
      âThese are the diets for someone whoâs got a wedding or an event they want to go to in the next few months,â she said. âWill you lose weight in the short term? Absolutely. Will you keep it off for the next two years? Probably not.â
   
      In the category of best (long-term) weight-loss diet, WW (formely called Weight Watchers) came in first, with DASH and TLC tied for second. WW also got top honors in the best (commercial) diet program, followed by NOOM and Jenny Craig.
   
      
      Changing your diet could add up to 13 years to your life, study says
     
      Flexitarian and TLC shared the gold in the category of easiest diet to follow, while the Mediterranean and DASH diets tied for third. 
   
      The DASH diet took top honors as best diet for heart health and for people with diabetes, followed by the Mediterranean, flexitarian and Ornish diets. The Ornish diet was created in 1977 by Dr. Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California. 
   
      The Ornish diet is combined with stress-management techniques, exercise, social support and smoking cessation, and according to Ornish is the only scientifically proven program to reverse heart disease without drugs or surgery

      Will democracy still be on a roll in 2023?
    
**************************
 
  Editorâs Note: This story was adapted from the January 3 edition of CNNâs Meanwhile in America, the email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.
 
      2022 was the year democracy bounced back. But will the worst political system apart from all the others keep up its lead in the year ahead?
   
      In the US last year, midterm election voters repudiated Donald Trumpâs election-denying extremist candidates; now the former Presidentâs reelection campaign â which is based on lies about 2020 â faces an existential crisis. Congress also passed a new law designed to make it harder for sore loser presidents like Trump to mess with the Constitution. In another blow to populist extremism, Brazilian voters ousted one of Trumpâs proteges, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. And in April, French President Emmanuel Macron defeated far right challenger Marine Le Pen.
   
      As democracies showed resilience, autocrats lost momentum in several countries last year. Soon after securing a norm-busting third term, Chinese leader Xi Jinping was embarrassed by nationwide outcry and forced to abandon a controversial âZero Covidâ policy. Iranâs clerical regime is still being rattled by a furious protest movement. And the pitfalls of surrounding yourself with yes men were exposed by Russian leader Vladimir Putinâs miscalculated âspecial operationâ in Ukraine, which has raised the profile of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a champion for democracy and revived the Westâs Cold War alliance.
   
      Democracyâs enemies wonât rest. Thereâs no sign that the challenges facing Moscow, Tehran or Beijing could loosen their iron grasps on power. Even in the US, Trump is on the comeback trail and a Republican majority (dominated by members who voted not to certify President Joe Bidenâs election in 2020) is poised to take over the US House of Representatives. 
   
      But those who thought they had democracy on the run in 2022 got a surprise. The simple magic of a voter marking their ballot in a polling booth or a protestor willing to put their life on the line for the right to do so remains as powerful as ever.
   
      Washington is bracing for a new era of divided government likely to bring governing showdowns, shutdowns, withering political investigations and the opening shots of the 2024 presidential race.
   
      Hereâs what we think will shape the year.

      Omicron offshoot XBB.1.5 could drive new Covid-19 surge in US
    
**************************
 
      For weeks, scientists have been watching a slew of Omicron descendants duke it out for dominance of Covid-19 transmission in the United States, with the BQs â BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 â seeming to edge out all the others to claim a slight lead.
   
      The result has been a gradual rise in cases and hospitalizations that never seemed to reach the peaks of this summerâs BA.5 wave and was certainly nothing like the tsunami of illness caused by the original Omicron strain a year ago.
   
      
      2022 ends with looming risk of a new coronavirus variant, health experts warn
     
      But on Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs Covid-19 variant dashboard revealed a new dark horse that could soon sweep the field: XBB.1.5. 
   
      The CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 has more than doubled its share of the Covid-19 pie each week for the last four, rising from about 4% to 41% of new infections over the month of December. In the Northeast, the CDC estimates, XBB.1.5 is causing 75% of new cases.
   
      âFor a few months now, we havenât seen a variant thatâs taken off at that speed,â said Pavitra Roychoudhury, director of Covid-19 sequencing at the University of Washington School of Medicineâs virology lab.
   
      
      US to require travelers from China to show negative Covid-19 test result before flight
     
      Virologists and epidemiologists say this Omicron sublineage has features that give it the potential to drive a new surge of Covid-19 cases in the US, although itâs still unclear how large that wave will be and whether it could send many more people to the hospital. 
   
      For all the recent concern that a new Covid-19 threat could come from Chinaâs ongoing surge, experts point out that XBB.1.5 appears to have arisen in the United States.  It was first detected in New York and Connecticut in late October, according to GISAID, a global effort to catalog and track variants of the coronavirus.
   
      Trevor Bedford, a professor of computational biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said XBB.1.5 has a growth rate similar to that of its distant cousin BA.5. 
   
      Bedford has pegged its effective reproductive number â the number of new infections expected to be caused by each infected person â at about 1.6, roughly 40% higher than its next closest competitor.
   
      âI expect it to drive increased circulation in the coming weeks,â Bedford wrote in an email. That increase may not be reflected in case numbers, he pointed out, since more people are testing at home, and their cases may not be counted unless they seek medical care and get a lab test to confirm their results. âSo Iâd look to hospitalizations in the vulnerable age groups [such as seniors] as better indicator of wave,â he wrote.
   
      XBB.1.5 is the product of recombination: Two descendants of BA.2, the subvariant that drove a modest wave of cases in the US in April, swapped pieces of their genetic code, resulting in 14 new mutations to the virusâ spike proteins compared with BA.2, and a new sublineage, XBB.  
   
      XBB drove a wave of cases in Singapore this fall but never gained much ground in the US. Here, it had to compete against a slew of co-circulating variants that had each independently evolved some of the same mutations, making them more equally matched.
   
      
      Flu, Covid-19 and RSV: Tracking hospitalizations this brutal virus season
     
      Still, scientists have been keeping a close eye on XBB and its spinoffs.
   
      Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, recently tested viruses engineered to have the spikes of XBB and XBB.1 as well as BQ.1 and BQ 1.1 in his lab against antibodies from the blood of people whoâd been infected, who were vaccinated with the original and new bivalent vaccines, and whoâd been both infected and vaccinated. His team also tested 23 monoclonal antibody treatments against these new sublineages. 
   
      He found that XBB.1 was the slipperiest of them all. It was 63 times less likely to be neutralized by antibodies in the blood of infected and vaccinated people than BA.2 and 49 times less likely to be neutralized compared with BA.4 and BA.5.

      In terms of immune evasion, Ho says, these variants have shifted as far away from the antibodies we have made to use against them as the original Omicron variant was from the Covid-19 viruses that preceded it roughly a year ago.  
   
      He calls these levels of immune evasion âalarmingâ and said they could further compromise the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines. His findings were recently published in the journal Cell.
   
      Ho said Monday that XBB.1.5 was the same story in terms of antibody evasion as XBB.1, which means it has the potential to escape the protections of vaccinations and past infections. Itâs also resistant to all current antibody treatments, including Evusheld.
   
      In addition to being highly immune evasive, XBB.1.5 has an additional trick up its sleeve that seems to be helping to fuel its growth. It has a key mutation at site 486, which allows it to bind more tightly to ACE2, the doors the virus uses to enter our cells.
   
      âThe mutation is clearly letting XBB.1.5 spread better,â Jesse Bloom, a computational virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, wrote in an email.
   
      
      Real-world studies show updated Covid-19 boosters offer important protection against urgent care visits and hospitalizations
     
      This mutation was first flagged by Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses and viral proteins, as one that could be important for viral fitness. It has been confirmed by Yunlong Cao at Peking University.
   
      âItâs got a better ability to get into cells,â Roychoudhury said, which means itâs more infectious.
   
      Still, experts say itâs hard to know how much of XBB.1.5âs growth can be attributed to properties of the virus and how much simply to good timing.
   
      Coming out of the holidays, during which time people were more likely to travel and socialize, gives any infection â whether itâs the flu, Covid-19 or RSV â more room to run.
   
      âMost public health officials would have expected an increase in Covid-19 cases, even before we knew about XBB.1.5.â said Andrew Pekosz, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies viral replication. âSo whether the increases in Covid cases that are occurring during the holidays are occurring because of the social interactions that people have had or whether theyâre specifically related to XBB.1.5 is still something that isnât clear. Both of those things are probably contributing.â
   
      Most experts said that while they expect that XBB.1.5 has the potential to cause more illness, they donât expect those infections to necessarily be more severe.
   
      Looking at the Northeast, where XBB.1.5 is thought to be causing the majority of infections, Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesotaâs Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, sees reason for hope. 
   
      Osterholm notes that the updated boosters should provide some protection, even against this highly immune evasive strain. 
   
    Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
   
      âThey still provide a level of immunity that may not prevent you from getting infected but may have a significant impact on whether or not you become seriously ill and die,â he said. âI mean, right now, the most recent data we have shows that for those who have the bivalent vaccine, they have a three-fold lower risk of dying than those who donât.â
   
      Americans have been slow to get the new boosters, however. According to CDC data, only 15% of Americans who are eligible have had an updated booster. Among seniors â those age 65 and older â only about 1 in 3 have had an updated shot.
   
      Experts also note that although antibody treatments wonât work against this sublineage, other antivirals, such as Paxlovid and remdesivir, should still be effective.
   
      Rapid tests continue to work, as do masks, and ventilation and filtration of indoor air, so even as the virus continues to evolve, there are still good ways to protect yourself from getting Covid-19.
   
      âIt doesnât appear to be causing any more severe illness, and so I think that itâs a very different situation circulating today than had it been a year ago,â Osterholm said. âThereâs so much more immunity in the population that I donât think that itâs going to take off.â

      âOne of the greatest performances in the history of the game.â Donovan Mitchell scores record 71 points for Cavs to join elite NBA group
    
**************************
 
      It was a high-scoring night in the NBA on Monday as both Donovan Mitchell and LeBron James set points records. 
   
      Mitchell scored 71 points â the highest single-game points total since Los Angeles Lakers great Kobe Bryant scored 81 against Toronto in 2006 â as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat Chicago Bulls 145-134 in overtime.
   
      His career-high total is a franchise record and, according to the NBA, Mitchell is the seventh player to score 70-plus points in a game. 
   
      Wilt Chamberlain owns the NBA record with 100 points for Philadelphia against New York on March 2, 1962. 
   
      âTo be there in the record book with guys like Wilt is truly humbling,â said Mitchell, per ESPN. âI always believed I could be one of the best players in the league. Iâm speechless and blessed to be in the company of that greatness.â
   
      Mitchell was soaked with water by his teammates at the end of the game, while his coach J.B. Bickerstaff described his performance as âone of the greatest performances in the history of the game.â
   
      âEvery single play that he made was a play that was necessary,â said Bickerstaff, according to ESPN. âDonovan has never put himself above the team, so how can you not root for a guy like that? I told everyone else to get out of the way.â
   
      Mitchell broke Jamesâ previous Cavaliers record of 57 points in a game. James had jointly owned that record with Kyrie Irving, though the NBA great also put his name in the history books on Monday. 
   
      In scoring 43 points as the Lakers beat the Charlotte Hornets 121-115, James became only the second player aged 35 or older to record back-to-back 40-plus point games. The other being Michael Jordan.

      Exclusive: This vodka brand actually wants to help you celebrate Dry January

      Itâs three days into Dry January for those who observe, but that doesnât mean you canât touch the vodka.
   
      Titoâs Handmade Vodka has enlisted Martha Stewart for a cheeky campaign that helps people who have temporarily abstained from alcohol with some ideas for what to do with their vodka â besides drinking it. 
   
      In a 60-second ad, Stewart uses her do-it-yourself knowledge to get creative with vodka, like putting a splash (or two) in a marinara sauce or deodorizing stinky boots. Other tongue-in-cheek ideas include Stewart encouraging people to use the Titoâs bottle to tenderize meat and to water their flowers with the vodka. âSmells like February,â she jokes in the ad. 
   
      To complement the campaign, Titoâs has launched an online store selling bottle-topper attachments to help people follow Stewartâs suggestions. For $10, buyers will get a box with three attachments, including a spray nozzle for deodorizing and a pour spout for the pasta or any other sauces that need a punch. Net proceeds from the box goes to charity.
   
      âWe are all about consumers drinking Titoâs the way they want to drink it. Whether that means theyâre drinking less, taking a month off, or trying new recipes, we are supportive of our fan baseâs consumption choices,â Taylor Berry, vice president of brand marketing for Titoâs, exclusively told CNN about the campaign. 
   
      âThe idea that you can still use Titoâs when youâre abstaining from alcohol is what has made this campaign so enjoyable to create,â Berry said. âFor those doing dry January, well, Titoâs will still be here for you come February.â
   
      Titoâs is no stranger to creating amusing ad campaigns to help the privately owned company break out in the $7 billion industry. In August, Titoâs sold empty cans that encouraged customers to make canned cocktails however they like them. The idea was a troll against the growing trend and to tell customers itâs focusing on its core product only.
   
      Dry January is growing in popularity every year. Last year, a Nielsen-owned food and drink research firm said that 35% of legal-age US adults skipped alcohol for the entire month â a trend thatâs growing in popularity as drinkers look to reset their bodies in the New Year. Thatâs an increase from the previous high of 21% who completed Dry January in 2019.
   
      Sales of non-alcoholic products are also growing: NielsenIQ recently reported that retail sales of non-alcoholic spirits jumped nearly 90% between August 2021 and August 2022, accounting for more than $5 million in sales. Still, thatâs a very small sliver of the $88 billion industry.
   
      Berry said thereâs âundoubtedly interest amongst consumersâ for non-alcoholic beverages because people are changing their drinking habits, although not necessarily ditching drinking for good. 
   
      âJust like many may choose to have a glass of water in between cocktails, some non-alcoholic beverages provide an alternative for drinkers when they want to moderate or feel like enjoying a drink without the alcohol by volume,â he said. âUltimately non-alcoholic drinks are mostly formulated to taste like familiar adult beverages, giving many consumers an occasional substitute, not necessarily an outright replacement.â

      âGOAT,â âinflection pointâ and âquiet quittingâ should be banished, annual list says
    
**************************
 
      For the love of all things sacred, please stop saying âGOATâ â unless you are shouting about a herd of mid-size animals.
   
      At least, thatâs how a team of judges from Michiganâs Lake Superior State University feel about the term â an acronym for the âGreatest of All Timeâ â  as it tops this yearâs Banished Words List. 
   
      The university has released its annual list, amassed from submissions from around the world, which highlights phrases or words that its judges deem misused, overused â or simply useless.  
   
      âGOAT,â along with âinflection point,â âquiet quittingâ and âgaslightingâ makes an appearance on the list, which has been released annually since 1976.
   
      
      'Goblin mode' chosen as Oxford word of the year for 2022
     
      The list serves âto uphold, protect, and support excellence in language by encouraging avoidance of words and terms that are overworked, redundant, oxymoronic, clichÃ©d, illogical, nonsensical â and otherwise ineffective, baffling, or irritating,â according to the university, which said it had received more than 1,500 nominations.
   
      âThe singularity of âgreatest of all timeâ cannot happen, no way, no how,â Peter Szatmary, executive director of marketing and communications at Lake State, said in a press release. âAnd instead of being selectively administered, itâs readily conferred. Remember Groucho Marxâs line about not wanting to join a club that would accept him as member?
   
      âThe nine additional words and terms banished for 2023 â from new no-nos âinflection pointâ at No. 2 and âgaslightingâ at No. 4 to repeat offenders âamazingâ at No. 6 and âIt is what it isâ at No. 10 â also fall somewhere on the spectrum between specious and tired. Theyâre empty as balderdash or diluted through oversaturation. Be careful â be more careful â with buzzwords and jargon,â he added.
   
      Here are the 10 that made this yearâs list.
   
      Nominators and judges alike took issue with the phrase, with one disgruntled contributor lamenting that the terminology is âapplied to everyone and everything from athletes to chicken wings.â
   
      This, judges say, is both overused and misused, as a âmathematical term that entered everyday parlance and lost its original meaning.â
   
      Quiet quitting â which some say means doing the bare minimum at work â was bandied around a lot last year. The term, judges mused, is âtrendy but inaccurate.â
   
      In fact, nominators said the real meaning behind it is simply ânormal job performance,â and ânothing more than companies complaining about workers refusing to be exploited.â
   
      Merriam-Websterâs 2022 word of the year, which the online dictionary defines as âthe act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for oneâs own advantage,â became the âfavored word for the perception of deception.â 
   
      But, nominators and judges in Michigan argue the word is both overused and misused, and âdisconnectsâ the term from the sinister physiological manipulation it is associated with.
   
      Included for misuse, overuse and uselessness.
   
      Already banished for misuse, overuse and uselessness in 2012, the word has again appeared in the list. Some nominators argued that it should be reserved for the truly âawe-inspiring,â and others simply felt it was a âworn-out adjective from people short on vocabulary.â
   
      Not just misused, overused and useless, judges went so far as to say that the phrase is âneedy, scheming, and/or cynical.â
   
      âAlways make sense; donât think aloud or play games,â judges firmly said. 
   
      Judges at Lake Superior say itâs not even a word â and âregardlessâ works just as well.
   
      First making the list in 1996, the word is apparently frequently âsaid too loudly by annoying people who think theyâre better than you,â said one observer, and âsounds like it comes with a guarantee when that may not be the case,â cautioned another.
   
      Another repeat offender. First banished in 2008 for overuse, misuse and uselessness, the phraseâs reentry sparked angry responses from nominators.
   
      âOf course it is what it is! What else would it be? It would be weird if it wasnât what it wasnât,â one user quipped.
   
      Another said the phrase provides an âexcuse not to deal with reality or accept responsibility.â

      Celine Dionâs exclusion from Rolling Stoneâs âGreatest Singers Listâ sparks outrage
    
**************************
 
      Near, far, wherever you are, thereâs anger over Celine Dion not being included on Rolling Stoneâs list of the 200 greatest singers of all time.
   
      Published on New Yearâs Day, the list ranges from Aretha Franklin to RosalÃ­a and other artists known for standout singing.
   
      But some on social media are calling out what they consider to be a Titanic mistake - Dionâs absence on the list.
   
      âRespectfully, not including Celine Dion, arguably the best vocal technician of all time, in this list is borderline treasonous,â producer, promoter and recording artist Jamie Lambert tweeted. 
   
      There were also complaints that others, including Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Sting, were not included.
   
      The publication appeared to anticipate the griping.
   
      âBefore you start scrolling (and commenting), keep in mind that this is the Greatest Singers list, not the Greatest Voices List,â the introduction noted. âTalent is impressive; genius is transcendent.â
   
      Dion recently announced she is postponing several Europe tour dates after being diagnosed with a neurological disorder that doesnât allow her âto sing the way Iâm used to.â 
   
      The condition she has, stiff-person syndrome, is âa rare, progressive syndrome that affects the nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord,â according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
   
      CNN has reached out to Rolling Stone for comment.
