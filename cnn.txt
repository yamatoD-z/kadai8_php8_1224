      McCarthy may have only himself to blame
    
**************************
 
      Governing by chaos is back.
   
      Two years after the master of political mayhem, ex-President Donald Trump, stormed out of Washington in disgrace, Republicans have finally won back some power. 
   
      But they still don???t know how to properly use it.
   
      After weeks of vowing to hold President Joe Biden to account, the new GOP House majority arrived in town Tuesday ??? and promptly failed in its most basic task: electing a speaker to lead it. A revolt of ultra-hardliners in an already hardline conference dealt humiliation to Kevin McCarthy, the California lawmaker who saw his decades-old dream of wielding the gavel dashed ??? at least for now.
   
      Trump, who is partly to blame for the debacle after contributing to a smaller-than-expected GOP House majority after his self-serving interventions in the midterm elections, called on holdouts Wednesday to get behind McCarthy.
   
      ???Republicans, do not turn a great triumph into a giant & embarrassing defeat,??? the ex-president wrote on his Truth Social platform in all-caps, saying McCarthy would do a good and ???maybe even a great job.???
   
      Many of the rebels are among Trump???s strongest supporters and McCarthy spoke to Trump on Tuesday night amid signs his support was beginning to fray.
   
      Even Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, known more for embracing conspiracy theories than stable governance, complained that the party was thwarting its own goals ???because 19 Republicans decided to blow up the Speaker???s race.??? (Greene backs McCarthy). 
   
      McCarthy became the first candidate to fall short in a first ballot for speaker in a century. Most poignantly, the impasse means Republicans are unable even to assume the control they won in the midterms as a new House can???t yet be sworn in.
   
      On a surreal day, the 118th Congress opened with Republicans fighting Republicans, while Democrats ??? who should have been mourning their lost majority ??? were joyous at the GOP circus they beheld. 
   
      ???Hakeem, Hakeem,??? Democrats chanted as their new leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, earned more votes than McCarthy in the first three roll calls of the new House the GOP is supposed to control ??? although he too fell short of the 218 majority. 
   
      At one point, Ohio firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan, a hero of the right, stood to nominate McCarthy for speaker, only for 19 of the rejectionists to vote that he should have the top job that he insists he doesn???t want. (Jordan is more interested in lacerating Biden???s appointees as chair of the Judiciary Committee).
   
      A daylong debacle, in which McCarthy appeared to have no strategy other than a beat-the-head-against-a-brick-wall approach, ended with the House in an absurd limbo. Smartly dressed family members who traveled to Washington to see their new lawmakers proudly sworn in were bored and disappointed. The House adjourned and will resume on Wednesday at noon, even though there???s little sign the deadlock will break.
   
      ???I didn???t think we were going to get any more productive by continuing on the day,??? McCarthy told reporters late Tuesday. But he insisted he wouldn???t be dropping out of the race. 
   
      ???It???s not going to happen,??? he said, adding, ???We only need 11 more votes to win,??? implying that he thinks he can get a number of members to vote present, which would lower the threshold he???d need.
   
      The picture will become clearer on Wednesday as the fourth vote looms, though a GOP source familiar with the matter tells CNN???s Manu Raju that it???s possible the House may adjourn to allow the talks to continue for the rest of the day.
   
      But there are some conclusions from Tuesday???s drama.
   
      ??? The GOP civil war, which erupted with the Tea Party backlash to the Obama administration, is far from burned out. It was responsible for the departures of Republican House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner and was put into overdrive by Trump. And as soon as the party had a sniff of power again, that strife burst into the open as radicals seek to destroy a party establishment that has already shifted far right to appease them.
   
      ??? Even if McCarthy prevails, he will be a weak speaker who may be in office but barely in power. The Californian had weeks to get his majority together. Either he inaccurately counted the votes or has no control over his conference. Neither scenario is likely to lead to a majority that effectively trains its fire on Democrats and the White House and can build a strong case for voters for the 2024 election. If Republicans can???t unite on an easy vote ??? for speaker ??? how will they come together on tough ones, on government spending bills, for example?
   
      ??? Political arsonists cannot be won over. Leadership sources say Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona and other members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus were offered multiple concessions by McCarthy, including weakening the speaker???s capacity to cling on to power. But they refused, making clear that this is as much about personalities as ideology. They brand McCarthy as a sell-out, the biggest alligator in the Washington ???swamp??? whom they will never trust. 
   
      ???Maybe the right person for the speaker of the House isn???t someone who has sold shares in himself for more than a decade to get it,??? Gaetz said on the floor on Tuesday in a cutting jab at McCarthy, who sat a few feet away. 
   
      ??? McCarthy may have nothing to offer the renegades to win their votes. They disdain big committee posts and don???t dream of passing signature bills. They don???t care that a majority of the GOP in the House wants McCarthy. For them, as it was for Trump, the chaos is the point. Taking on the ???swamp??? gets them booked on conservative talk shows, boosts their fundraising and polishes their MAGA credentials. 
   
      Former Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state ??? who voted to impeach Trump, lost a primary to a rival backed by the ex-president, who then went on to lose the general election to a Democrat ??? told CNN???s Jake Tapper Tuesday the rebels were in it for themselves.
   
      ???It???s just drama. ??? They have this outsize platform,??? she said. ???It???s just ridiculous.???
   
      ??? The tiny Republican majority ??? which means McCarthy could only afford to lose four votes for speaker ??? will dominate the 118th Congress. It not only gave the hardliners the chance to hold McCarthy hostage in the race for speaker; it will mean that at any moment, the House can be shut down over just a few votes. This isn???t just a concern for the eventual speaker. The White House should be worried too, given looming showdowns over government budgets and raising the debt ceiling. 
   
      Ironically, McCarthy may have only himself to blame. By quickly embracing Trump after initially criticizing him over the January 6, 2021, insurrection, he linked his party???s midterm election campaign irrevocably to Trump???s reputation. But many voters were alienated by the ex-president???s election denialism and landed McCarthy with a much smaller and more unworkable House majority than he expected.
   
      ??? One interpretation of the midterms was that voters ??? exhausted by the turbulence of the Trump years and a once-in-a-century pandemic ??? gave a cry for stability and calm and were therefore not willing to hand all the power available in November back to Republicans. (While they fell short of a red wave in the House, the GOP failed to win back the Senate and Democrats grew their majority). Farcical scenes in the House on Tuesday were hardly what those voters had in mind in November.
   
      ??? And Democrats are already trying to make political capital out of it, seeing vindication for their claims that Republicans are still not fit for power and should be kicked out at the first opportunity in the next election. ???I just watched House Republicans plunge into utter chaos on the House floor,??? Jeffries told Democratic donors in a fundraising email. ???This changes everything for Democrats. We now have a huge opportunity to step in and show what we can do.???
   
      If anything, McCarthy got weaker with each roll call, even if one senior GOP source told CNN he would never back down and ???we???re going to war.??? Some GOP members are now referring to the rebels as ???the chaos caucus??? or ???The Taliban 20,??? CNN???s Manu Raju reported. 
   
      But one lawmaker who opposed McCarthy, South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, vowed he???d fight on for ???six months??? if need be to thwart the Californian???s bid for speaker. Despite the tough talk, McCarthy ??? who rather prematurely took up residence in the speaker???s office suite ??? is left with painful realities. They include the question of whether his bid is doomed, given that it seems impossible that he can win over the most hardline handful of objectors. A few Republicans late Tuesday seemed to be toying with the possibility that another candidate could emerge ??? after the House turned into a farce and their party was made a laughing stock.
   
      But the chances of a compromise choice who could unite the ultra-right and more moderate members who won in Biden districts seems remote.
   
      McCarthy will get a fresh chance on Wednesday to show that he can bring his conference under control and finally bring some order to the new Republican majority ??? even if the path ahead remains impossible to identify. Perhaps a day of infighting will convince all Republicans they are at risk of squandering their majority.
   
      ???We have an agenda and we want to implement that agenda and we can either be the conference who comes together to do that or we can let a select few keep us from being able to do that,??? Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore told CNN???s Erin Burnett on Tuesday, arguing that McCarthy had been successful in leading his party back to power in the House. 
   
      ???You don???t take out a pitcher in the middle of a no-hitter,??? he added.
   
      But after his triple loss in votes for speaker Tuesday, McCarthy must now prove it???s not three strikes and you are out.

      ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ露 thought I would die on that boatﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・ Mother recalls the horror of month adrift at sea
    
**************************
 
      Hatemon Nesa weeps as she clings to her 5-year-old daughter, Umme Salima, at a rescue shelter in Indonesia???s Aceh province. Their faces appear gaunt, their eyes sullen, after drifting for weeks at sea on a boat with little food or water. 
   
      ???My skin was rotting off and my bones were visible,??? Nesa said. ???I thought I would die on that boat.???
   
      Nesa also cries for her 7-year-old daughter, Umme Habiba, who she says she was forced to leave behind in Bangladesh ??? she couldn???t afford any more than the $1,000 the traffickers demanded to transport her and her youngest child to Malaysia. ???My heart is burning for my daughter,??? she said.
   
      Nesa and Umme Salima were among around 200 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, who embarked on the dangerous voyage in late November from Cox???s Bazar, a sprawling refugee camp in Bangladesh crowded with around a million people who fled alleged genocide by the Myanmar military.
   
      But soon after they left, the engine cut out, turning what was supposed to be a 7-day journey into a month-long ordeal at sea, exposed to the elements in the open-topped wooden boat, surviving only on rainwater and just three days??? worth of food.
   
      Nesa said she saw starving men jump overboard in a desperate search for food, but they never returned. And she witnessed a baby die after being fed salt water from the sea.
   
      As the weeks wore on, the passengers??? families and aid agencies pleaded with governments in multiple countries to help them ??? but their cries were ignored. 
   
      Then on December 26, the boat was rescued by Indonesian fishermen and local authorities in Aceh, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). Of the 200 or so people who boarded the boat, only 174 survived ??? around 26 died on the boat, or are missing at sea, presumed dead.
   
      Babar Baloch, an Asia spokesperson for the agency, said after a lull during Covid, the numbers of people fleeing are back to pre-Covid levels. Some 2,500 boarded unseaworthy boats last year for the journey, and as many as 400 of them died, making 2022 one of the deadliest years in a decade for Rohingya escaping Cox???s Bazar.
   
      ???These are literally death traps that once you get in ??? you end up losing your life,??? he said. 
   
      Nesa and Salima???s journey began on November 25 from the overcrowded refugee camps in Cox???s Bazar, where she said her children couldn???t go to school, leaving her with little hope for their future. 
   
      Nesa said she had carried around two kilograms of rice for the journey, but shortly after the boat left the port, its engine died and they started drifting. 
   
      ???Starving with no food, we saw a fishing boat nearby and tried to go close,??? she said, crying as she recalled the horror. ???We jumped in the water to swim close to that boat but in the end, we could not.???
   
      During December, as the boat bobbed aimlessly in the Bay of Bengal, the UNHCR said it was spotted near India and Sri Lanka. But the agency said those countries ???continuously ignored??? its pleas for intervention.
   
      CNN has contacted the Indian and Sri Lankan Navies for comment but has not received a response. Last month, the Sri Lankan Navy said in a statement that its crews had made a ???strenuous effort??? to rescue another boat carrying 104 Rohingya, including many women and children, who had fled Bangladesh. 
   
      On December 18, Nesa???s brother, Mohammed Rezuwan Khan, who is in Cox???s Bazar, shared with CNN an audio clip of a harrowing phone call he received from one of the refugees aboard Nesa???s boat. 
   
      ???We are dying here,??? the man said via satellite phone, according to the recording. ???We haven???t eaten anything for eight to 10 days. We are starving.??? 
   
      Nesa said the boat???s driver and another crew member jumped into the ocean to find food, but they never returned. ???I think they got eaten by fish in the sea,??? she said. 
   
      Twelve other men entered the water, while holding onto a long rope attached to the boat to try to catch something to eat, but as others on the boat tried to pull them back in, the rope snapped, Nesa said. ???They could not return to the boat.???
   
      While all countries are bound by international law to rescue people in distress at sea, swift action is not always forthcoming ??? particularly where Rohingya refugees are concerned, according to Baloch, from the UNHCR.
   
      ???I think everyone will agree as human beings that we have the responsibility you want to save one life in distress, let alone hundreds of people dying,??? Baloch said. ???(Nearby states) have to act to save these desperate people. It has to be an action which is in coordination done collectively by all the states in the region.??? 
   
      Nesa and Umme Salima were among the 174 emaciated survivors shown on video setting foot on land for the first time in weeks in late December, some immediately collapsing onto the sand of an Aceh beach, too weak to stand.
   
      They are among the more fortunate ones ??? the UNHCR believes another 180 are presumed dead, lost at sea on another boat since early December, when the occupants stopped communicating with their families.
   
      The survivors from Nesa???s boat are now receiving medical care in Aceh, however it remains unclear what might happen to them in the coming weeks and months.  
   
      Indonesia is not party to the UN Refugee Convention and lacks a national refugee protection structure, according to the UNHCR.
   
      For those found to be refugees, UNHCR will begin to look for one of a range of what solutions, including resettlement to a third country or voluntary repatriation, if a person is able to ???return in safety and dignity.??? 
   
      This marks the start of a new chapter for the group of passengers, who have lived for years in overcrowded, unhygienic and unsafe refugee camps in Bangladesh, after fleeing decades of systematic discrimination, widespread brutality and sexual violence in their home country of Myanmar. 
   
      ???Stateless, persecuted, these Rohingya refugees have known little peace,??? said UNHCR???s Baloch. 
   
      Much more needs to be done by the international community for the persecuted group, who suffer on a scale most cannot imagine, he added.
   
      For Nesa, the hope remains that she might be reunited with her other daughter some day. 
   
      ???I was about to die (in Bangladesh),??? she said. ???Allah gave me a new life ??? My children should get a proper education. That is all that I wanted.???

      Indians demand justice for Delhi woman dragged to her death
    
**************************
 
      Angry crowds gathered in Delhi on Tuesday, demanding justice for a scooter rider who was killed and dragged by a car for miles through the streets of India???s capital.
   
      Delhi police said the 20-year-old woman???s scooter collided with the car in the early hours of January 1 before her body was pulled for up to 12 kilometers (more than 7 miles).
   
      ???We have information that the girl???s body was stuck in the car somehow and was dragged for about 10-12 kilometers,??? Delhi police official Sagar Hooda told a news conference Monday. ???Then at a turning, the body was dropped from the car.???
   
      Five people have been arrested in connection with the incident, Hooda said. 
   
      A witness who was with the victim at the time of the collision is cooperating with police, he added.
   
      ???She was not injured and she left the site of the accident,??? he said, referring to the witness. ???The investigation is ongoing ??? we are looking at multiple angles and will soon complete it and the accused will get the strictest punishment possible.???
   
      The woman???s body was badly mutilated, with her torn clothes found near her body, according to Harendra Singh, a senior Delhi police official. 
   
      ???The back of the head and her back were destroyed because of being dragged for so long,??? he said. 
   
      The grisly details have sparked outrage in India, with headlines dominating prime time news and many taking to the streets to demand strict punishment for the alleged perpetrators. On Monday, hundreds gathered outside a police station in the district where the incident took place. 
   
      Senior politicians have also called for an investigation.
   
      ???My head hangs in shame over the inhuman crime,??? Delhi???s Lt. Gov. Vinai Saxena wrote on Twitter Monday. ???I am shocked at the monstrous insensitivity of the perpetrators ??? All aspects are being thoroughly looked into.??? 
   
      Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi???s chief minister, said he had asked authorities ???to take exemplary action against culprits.???  
   
      Road accidents are common in India, where drivers often break traffic rules and safety regulations are not always strictly enforced. 
   
      In 2021, nearly 154,000 deaths were recorded on India???s roads, according to the Transport Ministry. Meanwhile, nearly 58,000 hit-and-run incidents were reported nationwide.

      Israelﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 rightward shift leaves its new Arab allies in an awkward spot
    
**************************
 
  Editor???s Note: A version of this story appears in today???s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN???s three-times-a-week look inside the region???s biggest stories. Sign up here.
 
      It was a rare embrace between one of Israel???s most controversial politicians and an Arab ambassador. Itamar Ben Gvir and the United Arab Emirates??? Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja clutched each other???s hands in a warm greeting in Tel Aviv in early December.   
   
      ???Birds of a feather flock together,??? wrote a columnist in Israel???s left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, arguing that the Abraham Accords, which saw Israel gain recognition from four Arab states including the UAE in 2020, did little to moderate Israel???s position on the Palestinians. Ben Gvir, he said, was ???a superstar in the UAE.???   
   
      Israel on Thursday swore in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history, led by six-time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, became national security minister. Bezalel Smotrich, who supports abolishing the Palestinian Authority and annexing the West Bank, became finance minister.   
   
      Both politicians were invited to national day celebrations in December hosted by the UAE and Bahrain, which were among the nations that normalized relations with Israel, along with Morocco and Sudan in 2020.    
   
      ???The Emirates are here to show that unity equals prosperity,??? Al Khaja was cited by the Times of Israel as saying at his country???s national day celebration, where he was photographed with Ben Gvir. ???We will continue to use diplomacy to deepen connections through friendship and mutual respect.???   
   
      The public embrace of figures that are hated in the Arab world ??? and are divisive within Israel itself ??? is a rare gesture on the part of Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel.    
   
      Egypt and Jordan, who recognized Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively, have had what observers have called a ???cold peace??? with Israel.   
   
      
      How the UAE went from boycotting Israel to investing billions in its economy
     
      In his phone call to congratulate Netanyahu on returning as prime minister, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ???emphasized the need to avoid any measures that would lead to tension and complicate the regional situation.??? Jordan???s King Abdullah II warned in a CNN interview last month that his nation was ???prepared??? for conflict should the situation change at Jerusalem???s al-Aqsa mosque, of which he is the custodian.   
   
      The rightward direction of Israeli politics puts Israel???s new Arab partners in an awkward position regarding the Palestinian cause, which remains a central issue among Arab publics.    
   
      ???It is awkward not just for us (in the UAE), but for everybody, in America, and all over the place,??? Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political science professor in the UAE, told CNN. ???It is a dilemma, but the way to deal with it is just to wait and see.???   
   
      An opinion poll by The Washington Institute for Near East Policy in July 2022 showed that support for the Abraham Accords had dropped in Gulf countries to a minority view, including the UAE and Bahrain, where more than 70% of the public views the agreement negatively. The data however also showed that around 40% of people in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain support maintaining business and sporting ties with Israel.   
   
      The normalizing states appear to be cognizant of that. On Friday, all four Arab states continued the tradition of supporting the Palestinians at the United Nations by voting at the General Assembly to seek the International Criminal Court???s opinion on the legal consequences of Israel???s occupation of Palestinian territories. Netanyahu called the vote ???despicable.???   
   
      But Israeli media has reported that behind the scenes, the Emiratis have also been sending messages of concern to Netanyahu about the inclusion of extremists in his government. Ahead of the Israeli elections, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah Bin Zayed warned Netanyahu against including Ben Gvir and Smotrich in his government, the Times of Israel reported, citing a senior official. Axios, which first reported the news, said Netanyahu didn???t respond.   
   
      The move would be a rare case of one of Israel???s Arab partners showing a preference for the country???s domestic politics.    
   
      The UAE foreign ministry didn???t respond to CNN???s request for comment. 
   
      Israeli analyst Zvi Bar???el wrote in Haaretz that the December move to embrace Ben Gvir may have been linked to Abu Dhabi???s desire to steer Israeli policy, adding that it made the UAE ???the Arab country with the greatest influence on the new Israeli government.???   
   
      The effectiveness of the UAE???s diplomacy within Israel remains to be seen. So far, Israel???s extremist minister seems unrestrained.   
   
      
      Jordan king warns of 'red lines' in Jerusalem as Netanyahu returns to office
     
      Less than a week since he was sworn in, Ben Gvir made a controversial visit to the al-Aqsa mosque compound escorted by Israeli police on Tuesday. The mosque, which lies in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, is in an area known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. It is the third holiest site for Muslims and the holiest for Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount. Under current arrangements, non-Muslims aren???t allowed to pray there and Ben Gvir wants to change that.   
   
      The UAE ???strongly??? condemned Ben Gvir???s visit without naming the minister, and called for the need to respect Jordan???s custodianship of the holy site. It later joined China in calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on the matter.   
   
      ???However unhappy they (Bahrain and the UAE) might be towards the emergence of Israel???s most right-wing government, it???s clear that they???ve chosen to air these concerns privately, and have stopped short of letting them stand in the way of what they see as an important strategic relationship,??? Elham Fakhro, a research fellow at the Centre for Gulf Studies at the University of Exeter, England, told CNN.   
   
      But the UAE has said earlier that the more friendly ties with the Arab world weren???t a green light for Israel to expand its territory. In June 2020, Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, warned Israel that its relations with Arab nations would suffer if there is any ???illegal seizure of Palestinian land.???   
   
      Abdullah, the professor from the UAE, said that Abu Dhabi may have some leverage over Israel that it may use privately at times, but added that ultimately ???everybody knows that nobody today has any leverage over Israel. Even America.???   
   
      Still, the UAE-Israel relationship is not everlasting, he said. ???This relationship is going to be dictated by the UAE??? When it doesn???t serve the interest of the UAE??? it can collapse at any time.???

      Turkey???s ruling party mulls bringing elections ???slightly??? forward 
   
      Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan???s ruling AK Party is considering a ???slight change??? on the date of elections scheduled for mid-June, Reuters cited AK Party spokesman Omer Celik as saying on Monday. Since the date of the elections corresponds with the summer holiday season, the party is evaluating bringing it ???slightly forward,??? he said. 
   
      Amnesty condemns Iran for upholding protester death sentence 
   
      Amnesty International on Monday condemned the Iranian supreme court???s decision to uphold the death sentence of protester Mohammad Boroughani, who according to Iranian state media is accused of stabbing a security guard during a protest.  
   
      Iran???s judiciary indicts two French nationals and a Belgian for espionage 
   
      Iran has indicted two French nationals and a Belgian for espionage and working against the country???s national security, Reuters reported, citing the semi-official Student News Network on Tuesday. The agency did not give the names of the three or say where or when they were indicted. 
   
      Regional: #HalaRonaldo (Hello, Ronaldo) 
   Warms my heart to see him in all smiles again. #HalaRonaldo #Hala_Ronaldo???? #Hala_Ronaldo #AlNassr #CristianoRonaldo???? #goat #GOAT????7  #HalaRonaldo pic.twitter.com/WGBK9sea6Z 
      Soccer fans in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are celebrating the arrival of famed Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo in Riyadh, who touched down in the kingdom on Tuesday ahead of his unveiling ceremony with the Al Nassr Football Club.  
   
      Twitter was flooded with images of Ronaldo wearing the club???s yellow and blue colors, smiling on large billboards in the Saudi capital. Memes showed ???sheikh Ronaldo??? dressed in Arab attire, and another showed him wearing a jersey with the ???Just do it??? slogan for his sponsor Nike crossed out and replaced with ???inshallah??? ??? God-willing in Arabic.   
   
      A magazine in Saudi Arabia even put out ads for a full-time ???Ronaldo correspondent,??? Esquire magazine reported. 
   
      ???Welcome to the greatest player in the world,??? tweeted one Saudi user, sharing a video of a framed photograph of Ronaldo holding his Al Nassr jersey.  
   
      ???The streets of Riyadh welcome Ronaldo,??? tweeted one Kuwaiti social media influencer, saying Saudis are lucky their country has become home to such a high-status player. 
   
      The celebrations quickly faded for some, however, when a video showing Ronaldo mistakenly refer to his new home as ???South Africa??? on Tuesday went viral. ???So, for me it???s not the end of my career to come in South Africa. This is why I wanna change. And to be honest I don???t really worry about what the people say,??? the soccer star said at a press conference in Riyadh on Tuesday. 
   
      Some joked that Ronaldo accepted a large sum to play in Saudi Arabia only to get the country???s name wrong.  
   
      Al Nassr FC announced on December 30 that the footballer was joining their team, tweeting a photo of Ronaldo in its jersey. The 37-year-old was a free agent and immediately available due to his high-profile break-up with Manchester United last month.

      Cristiano Ronaldo ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ湾roudﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・of move to Al Nassr and says his work in Europe is ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ賄oneﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・    
**************************
 
      Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was officially unveiled by his new Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on Tuesday in Riyadh, explaining he made the move having ???won everything??? in Europe.
   
      Ronaldo will earn an estimated $200 million a year with Al Nassr, according to Saudi state-owned media.
   
      ???I???m so proud to make this big decision in my life, in football. As you mentioned before, in Europe my work, it???s done. I won everything,??? the five-time Ballon d???Or winner said. ???I played the most important clubs in Europe and for me now, it???s a new challenge.???
   
      
      Cristiano Ronaldo signs for Saudi team Al Nassr
     
      The 37-year-old also revealed a number of clubs from around the world had attempted to sign him. 
   
      ???I had many opportunities in Europe, many clubs, in Brazil, in Australia, US, even in Portugal. Many clubs tried to sign me but I give the word to this club for the opportunity,??? he said.
   
      Despite a disappointing Qatar 2022 with Portugal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. He started Portugal???s round of 16 and quarterfinal matches on the substitutes bench, losing his place in the starting lineup after manager Fernando Santos opted to play Gon?§alo Ramos in his place.
   
      That came soon after his high-profile breakup with Manchester United, which was caused by an interview with TalkTV???s Piers Morgan where Ronaldo said he felt ???betrayed??? by the Premier League club.
   
      In the interview, he also stated he had a lack of respect for manager Erik ten Hag, and cast doubt on whether he would return to the team.
   
      Despite clearly slowing down on the pitch in the twilight of his career, the Portuguese star was adamant he would be able to have an impact with Al Nassr.
   
      ???I???m a unique player so it???s good coming here,??? Ronaldo said. ???I beat all records there so I want to beat a few records here as well.
   
      ???So for me, it???s a good chance, as you say this contract is unique, because I???m a unique player as well so for me it???s normal.???

      California man under arrest for attempted murder after police say he allegedly intentionally drove off a cliff with 1 woman and 2 children in car
    
**************************
 
      A 41-year-old California man was placed under arrest Tuesday on multiple charges after he allegedly intended to drive off a cliff on the Pacific Coast Highway with three passengers in the car, authorities said. 
   
      All four occupants of the Tesla survived the crash on Monday after the car plunged between 250 and 300 feet below the road it was on and into a rocky beach area known as Devil???s Slide, about 20 miles south from San Francisco, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
   
      
      Tesla plunges 250 feet off a California cliff, all 4 occupants survive
     
      In addition to the driver, an adult woman, a 9-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl were in the car when the crash happened Monday morning, according to Brian Pottenger, a battalion chief with Cal Fire???s Coastside Fire Protection District. 
   
      They were all taken to a local hospital with serious injuries, the highway patrol said Tuesday. The San Mateo County Sheriff???s Office previously said in a social media post that the children were ???unharmed.???
   
      ???Based on the evidence collected, investigators developed probable cause to believe this incident was an intentional act,??? the state???s highway patrol said in a news release Tuesday announcing the driver???s arrest. 
   
      The driver, from Pasadena, California, was arrested for attempted murder and child endangerment, according to the arrest report. He will be formally booked into San Mateo County Jail after his hospital treatment is completed, the highway patrol added. 
   
      The relationship between the driver and passengers remained unclear Tuesday. 
   
      The four-door, white Tesla was traveling southbound on Highway 1 just south of the Tom Lantos Tunnel between Pacifica and Montara on Monday morning when it veered off the roadway. It plunged at least 250 feet below that road, and a dramatic rescue mission ensued to ensure the occupants were taken out of the car safely. 
   
      ???The damage to the vehicle would indicate that it hit, and then flipped several times,??? Pottenger explained. The car came to rest on its wheels, he added.
   
      On Tuesday, the highway patrol pointed out that Tesla???s tech savvy driving features were not involved in what caused the crash. 
   
      ???There has been no determination as to what driving mode the Tesla was in; however, that does not appear to be a contributing factor in this incident,??? the highway patrol said. 
   
      The California Highway Patrol is investigating the crash. 
   
      The California Highway Patrol was alerted about the crash around 10:50 a.m. local time on Monday. 
   
      Upon first-responders arrival, all four occupants were conscious, and the two children were secured into their car seats that remained intact, according to Pottenger. All were trapped inside the smashed car, officials said. 
   
      
      Jennifer Hart drove her six children to their deaths as her wife looked up how much they would suffer, a jury says 
     
      The California Highway Patrol posted dramatic video of the helicopter lowering a rescuer on a cable to the crash site while surf crashed against the rocks below.
   
      As firefighters rappelled down the cliff to the car, other first-responders watched through binoculars. 
   
      ???As we were doing that, we were able to notice movement in the front seat through the windshield,??? Pottenger said. ???So we knew that we had at least one person that was alive.???
   
      Crews freed the two children and used a rope to lift them up the cliff in baskets. Later, a California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted the two adults to safety.

Russia's war in Ukraine
**************************
 Live Damar Hamlin in critical condition Live The House speaker vote Live Russia's war in Ukraine By Kathleen Magramo, Jack Guy, Adrienne Vogt, Mike Hayes and Leinz Vales, CNN From CNN's Olga Voitovych and Sarah Dean The Ukrainian military said Wednesday the use of cell phones by Russian troops was not the main reason their position was located in Makiivka, leading to a devastating strike in the eastern Donetsk region. “Of course, using phones with geolocation is a mistake. But it is clear that this version looks a bit ridiculous,” according to the spokesman for the Eastern Group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Serhii Cherevatyi. The Russian Ministry of Defense on Wednesday appeared to blame the soldiers themselves for the Ukrainian strike, saying that “the main cause” of the incident was the widespread use of cell phones by Russian soldiers “contrary to the ban,” allowing Ukraine to “track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers' locations.” Russia also revised its estimate of soldiers killed, from 63 to 89. Cherevatyi said “to deploy such large batches of newly mobilized ? which means not very trained, not very coordinated ? people in large rooms unsuitable for sheltering in case of danger, is a very weak excuse.”? “Of course, this is a mistake [of the Russians], and I think that now they are engaged in [searching for] who is to blame. They are putting the blame on each other,” he continued. Four rockets from US-made HIMARS launchers were used in the strike in Makiivka, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The Ukrainian military has claimed up to around 400 Russian soldiers died in the strike, but later added the number was "being clarified." CNN cannot independently verify either figure.  From CNN’s Anna Chernova   Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a frigate, the "Admiral Gorshkov," to be sent into combat service on Wednesday. The ship will undertake a long-range sea voyage across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea, reported Russian state media outlet TASS, citing Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The frigate is equipped with “the latest Zircon hypersonic missile system, which has no analogs - a sea-based hypersonic system - as well as other weapons of the latest generations,” Putin said, speaking via video link with Shoigu and the ship's commander, Igor Krokhmal. “I am sure that such powerful weapons will make it possible to reliably protect Russia from potential external threats and will help ensure the national interests of our country,” Putin added. According to Shoigu, the frigate will “conduct exercises” with Zircon hypersonic missiles. “I am very happy,?congratulations! This is great joint work, which ended with a good, expected result,” Putin said before ordering the frigate to “start completing the tasks.” From CNN's Radina Gigova   The governor of Russia's southwestern?Samara region?held talks in Moscow on Tuesday with the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry, after dozens of Russian military deaths in the city of Makiivka in the Donetsk region, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Some of the servicemen, who died?in the strike that took place just after midnight on Sunday at a vocational school housing Russian conscripts, were mobilized from Samara region, according to RIA Novosti, quoting the Samara region?Gov. Dmitry Azarov.? The Russian Defense Ministry has said 89 servicemen were killed in the strike. The Ukrainian military initially claimed up to around 400 Russian soldiers were killed, later adding that the number was "being clarified." CNN cannot independently verify either side’s reported death toll. In either case, the strike marks one of the?deadliest episodes of the conflict?for Moscow’s forces. Azarov agreed on "full coordination with the actions of the Ministry of Defense and the region," the agency reported.? Issues related to medical care for servicemen mobilized from the territory of Samara region, additional uniforms and other issues "have been worked out," according to RIA Novosti.? "Verified official data is very important now. As information becomes available on each serviceman, we will bring information to relatives and friends," Azarov said, according to RIA Novosti, quoting the regional press service.? On Wednesday,?Azarov?plans to visit wounded?servicemen from Samara at a regional hospital in the city of Rostov-on-Don, the state media agency said.? Ceremonies for the dead: Residents in the city of Samara held a mourning ceremony on Tuesday for the Russian servicemen killed in Makiivka. Residents?gathered at Glory Square in Samara attended a memorial service and observed a moment of silence in memory of the soldiers, after which they laid flowers at the eternal flame, the agency said. A memorial ceremony also took place in the neighboring city of?Togliatti, where members of the military,?representatives of veteran and public organizations, and residents had gathered in the city's?Victory Park,?the agency reported.?  From CNN's Mick Krever Ukraine’s defense intelligence chief has predicted that there will be attacks “deeper and deeper” inside Russia, without acknowledging whether Kyiv has played a role in such attacks up to this point. In an interview broadcast on ABC News on Wednesday, Major General Kyrylo?Budanov,?head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Agency, said that he was “very glad to see” attacks inside Russia, but that he was unable to “give you [an] answer” about whether Ukraine has played a role in such strikes until after the war. The Russian Defense Ministry said that three Russian servicemen were killed last month when a Ukrainian drone crashed near Engels-2 military airfield, hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border, according to Russian state news agency?RIA?Novosti. “Do you think there will be more?” the reporter asked Budanov. “I think so,” he replied. “Inside Russia? Deep inside Russia?” the reporter asked. “Deeper and deeper,” said Budanov. Recriminations over an attack which killed at least dozens of Russian troops in occupied Makiivka continue Wednesday. Russia's Ministry of Defense blames soldiers' use of personal cellphones for the attack, but a prominent Russian blogger has called the official line "not convincing."   Meanwhile, the leader of Russia's Wagner private military company has said its forces have failed to take the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine because there is "a fortress in every house." Here are the latest headlines: From CNN's Olga Voitovych in Kyiv Preparations for the transfer of a Patriot air defense battery from the United States are already underway, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “We look forward to the deployment of Patriot as soon as possible,” said Kuleba in a video?posted to Facebook on Wednesday. “Preparations for the transfer of these systems have already begun.”   President Joe Biden announced last month that the US would transfer a?Patriot air defense battery, along with munitions, to Ukraine. “Now President Zelensky and the entire diplomatic team are intensively working on new solutions for the supply of new types of Western weapons,” Kuleba said.  “First of all, we are talking about the supply of Western-style tanks and other armored vehicles. I have no doubt that the Ukrainian army will soon have additional armor and firepower." ? Continuing his criticism of Russian authorities, a top Russian military blogger has warned that apathy on the battlefield will lead to more “tragedies,” like the dozens and perhaps hundreds of Russian soldiers killed in a strike on occupied Makiivka over the weekend. Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias WarGonzo, said: “If you ask me personally what is the most dangerous thing in war, I will answer unequivocally: not to bother.”? “After ten months of the special military operation, it should be clear to even the most notorious slowpokes: this war cannot be won at random,”?he said.  Since the invasion began in February, Moscow has referred to the war as a “special military operation.” It was?his second lengthy post on Wednesday reflecting on an apparent Ukrainian strike this weekend, which the Russian Defense Ministry has now admitted killed 89 soldiers -- one of the most devastating single incidents for Moscow since its invasion.  In an earlier post on Wednesday, Pegov said that the lists of missing are “noticeably longer” than those already acknowledged by officials. Ukrainian authorities have claimed that up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed and 300 wounded. Russian President Vladimir Putin?personally awarded?Pegov with the Order of Courage at the Kremlin on December 20. Earlier Wednesday, Pegov warned that the “only cure” was to not lodge soldiers together in large buildings. “The banal thing is not to settle 500 people in one place, but to scatter them over ten different locations,” he said. “Yes, that takes a lot of work. But it's a matter of life and death.”  From CNN's Josh Pennington and Mick Krever   The head of Russia’s Wagner private military company has attempted to explain his group’s failure to capture the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which has for months been the scene of intense fighting. During a New Year’s visit with fighters on the front line,?Yevgeny Prigozhin said that there was “a fortress in every house” in Bakhmut, and that “only clowns that sit around and try to predict these things.” “Sometimes it takes entire weeks to clear a house, right?” he asked soldiers in?a video posted to a Wagner Telegram channel over the weekend.  “They say, ‘the combined forces have advanced into Artyomovsk and broken the defense,’” he said, referring to Bakhmut by its Soviet name. The name was changed back to Bakhmut in 2016. “Then they say: ‘What does it mean to “break through the defense?”’ ‘Breaking through the defense’ means breaking through the defense of one house this morning, then you have to go break the defense of the next house, right?" he said.  "And it’s not just one line of defense. How many lines of defense are there in Artyomovsk? If we said 500, that would be about accurate, right?” The fighters confirm that there is a Ukrainian line of defense “every 10 meters,” before Prigozhin continues. “Therefore the question is: “Who is going to take Artyomovsk? Which combined forces? It’ll be the Wagner combined forces,”?he said.?“And who else? Other than Wagner PMC, who else is there?” “No one else,” the soldiers said. Prigozhin denied any affiliation with Wagner for years, but in September finally admitted to founding the group in 2014. He has since appeared frequently on social media, attempting to fashion Wagner’s image as the most capable outfit in Russia’s war in Ukraine. “This year we will win! But first we will conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption,”?Prigozhin?says in another video.? “Once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world,” he adds. “The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption won’t listen to us because for New Year’s they are all drinking champagne.” From CNN's Olga Voitovych and Mick Krever A top Russian military blogger has railed against the Russian Ministry of Defense’s explanation of how dozens of soldiers were targeted in eastern Ukraine, calling the official story "not convincing" and "a blatant attempt to smear blame." Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias WarGonzo and was personally awarded?the Order of Courage by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on December 20, said that the death toll in Makiivka was likely far greater than the 89 now officially acknowledged by Russia. "The lists of the missing are, unfortunately, noticeably longer," he said. The Russian Ministry of Defense has appeared to blame the soldiers themselves for a Ukrainian strike on Russian-occupied Makiivka. It said the "main cause" of the incident was the widespread use of cell phones by Russian soldiers "contrary to the ban," which allowed Ukraine to "track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers' locations." On Wednesday Pegov said that, while the use of mobile phones near the front lines was "obviously" not a good thing, "the story with ‘mobiles’ is not too convincing." "This is not a personal opinion, it is objective," he said.  He questioned how the Ministry of Defense could be "so sure" that the location of soldiers lodging in a school building could not have been determined using drone surveillance, or a local informant. "Coordinates of objects are being leaked, and important people's movements are regularly ‘tipped off’ to the SBU," the?Security Service of Ukraine, he said.  "The network works, it does not sleep," said Pegov.  "Neither do Ukrainian drones in the skies above Donetsk and Makiivka, which can provide not just information about the accumulation of subscribers, but also confirm it visually." He also argued that Ukraine’s military would not use American-made HIMARS missiles unless it were certain of its target. "This is an expensive high-precision weapon. Before striking with HIMARS, the enemy obviously verifies the information," he said. Ukraine does not fire "just for luck." Pegov once again questioned the official Russian death toll, which was increased from 63 to 89 early Wednesday, already making it one of the most devastating single attacks against Russia in the war. "Unfortunately their number will still be growing," he said. "The figures are most likely for those who were able to be identified immediately." "I cannot reveal my sources, but I think they are reliable," added Pegov. "We double-checked them several times with the guys." Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.

      CNN Exclusive: A single Iranian attack drone found to contain parts from more than a dozen US companies
    
**************************
 
      Parts made by more than a dozen US and Western companies were found inside a single Iranian drone downed in Ukraine last fall, according to a Ukrainian intelligence assessment obtained exclusively by CNN. 
   
      The assessment, which was shared with US government officials late last year, illustrates the extent of the problem facing the Biden administration, which has vowed to shut down Iran???s production of drones that Russia is launching by the hundreds into Ukraine.
   
      CNN reported last month that the White House has created an administration-wide task force to investigate how US and Western-made technology ??? ranging from smaller equipment like semiconductors and GPS modules to larger parts like engines ??? has ended up in Iranian drones. 
   
      The options for combating the issue are limited. The US has for years imposed tough export control restrictions and sanctions to prevent Iran from obtaining high-end materials. Now US officials are looking at enhanced enforcement of those sanctions, encouraging companies to better monitor their own supply chains and, perhaps most importantly, trying to identify the third-party distributors taking these products and re-selling them to bad actors. 
   
      There is no evidence suggesting that any of those companies are running afoul of US sanctions laws and knowingly exporting their technology to be used in the drones. Even with many companies promising increased monitoring, controlling where these highly ubiquitous parts end up in the global market is often very difficult for manufacturers, experts told CNN. Companies may also not know what they are looking for if the US government has not caught up with and sanctioned the actors buying and selling the products for illicit purposes. 
   
      And the Ukrainian intelligence assessment is further proof that despite sanctions, Iran is still finding an abundance of commercially available technology.
   
      Of the 52 components Ukrainians removed from the Iranian Shahed-136 drone, 40 appear to have been manufactured by 13 different American companies, according to the assessment.
   
      The remaining 12 components were manufactured by companies in Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Taiwan, and China, according to the assessment. 
   
      Sanctioned Iranian companies appear to be successfully working around efforts to cut off their supply of crucial components and electronics. For example, the company that built the downed drone, Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Corporation (HESA), has been under US sanctions since 2008. 
   
      One major issue is that it is far easier for Russian and Iranian officials to set up shell companies to use to purchase the equipment and evade sanctions than it is for Western governments to uncover those front companies, which can sometimes take years, experts said. 
   
      ???This is a game of Whack-a-Mole. And the United States government needs to get incredibly good at Whack-a- Mole, period,??? said former Pentagon official Gregory Allen, who now serves as Director of the Artificial Intelligence Governance Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ???This is a core competency of the US national security establishment ??? or it had better become one.??? 
   
      Allen, who recently co-authored an investigation into the efficacy of US export controls, said ultimately, ???there is no substitute for robust, in-house capabilities in the US government.??? 
   
      He cautioned that it is not an easy job. The microelectronics industry relies heavily on third party distributors and resellers that are difficult to track, and the microchips and other small devices ending up in so many of the Iranian and Russian drones are not only inexpensive and widely available, they are also easily hidden.
   
      ???Why do smugglers like diamonds???? Allen said. ???Because they???re small, lightweight, and worth a ton of money. And unfortunately, computer chips have similar properties.??? Success won???t necessarily be measured in stopping 100% of transactions, he added, but rather in making it more difficult and expensive for bad actors to get what they need. 
   
      The rush to stop Iran from manufacturing the drones is growing more urgent as Russia continues to deploy them across Ukraine with relentless ferocity, targeting both civilian areas and key infrastructure. Russia is also preparing to establish its own factory to produce them with Iran???s help, according to US officials. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian forces had shot down more than 80 Iranian drones in just two days. 
   
      Zelensky also said that Ukraine had intelligence that Russia ???is planning a prolonged attack with Shaheds,??? betting that it will lead to the ???exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector.???  
   
      A separate probe of Iranian drones downed in Ukraine, conducted by the UK-based investigative firm Conflict Armament Research, found that 82% of the components had been manufactured by companies based in the US.??￣
   
      Damien Spleeters, the Deputy Director of Operations at Conflict Armament Research, told CNN that sanctions will only be effective if governments continue to monitor what parts are being used and how they got there. 
   
      ???Iran and Russia are going to try to go around those sanctions and will try to change their acquisition channels,??? Spleeters said. ???And that???s precisely what we want to focus on: getting in the field and opening up those systems, tracing the components, and monitoring for changes.???
   
      Experts also told CNN that if the US government wants to beef up enforcement of the sanctions, it will need to devote more resources and hire more employees who can be on the ground to track the vendors and resellers of these products.
   
      ???Nobody has really thought about investing more in agencies like the Bureau of Industry Security, which were really sleepy parts of the DC national security establishment for a few decades,??? Allen, of CSIS, said, referring to a branch of the Commerce Department that deals primarily with export controls enforcement. ???And now, suddenly, they???re at the forefront of national security technology competition, and they???re not being resourced remotely in that vein.???
   
      According to the Ukrainian assessment, among the US-made components found in the drone were nearly two dozen parts built by Texas Instruments, including microcontrollers, voltage regulators, and digital signal controllers; a GPS module by Hemisphere GNSS; a microprocessor by NXP USA Inc.; and circuit board components by Analog Devices and Onsemi. Also discovered were components built by International Rectifier ??? now owned by the German company Infineon ??? and the Swiss company U-Blox. 
   
      CNN sent emailed requests for comment last month to all the companies identified by the Ukrainians. The six that responded emphasized that they condemn any unauthorized use of their products, while noting that combating the diversion and misuse of their semiconductors and other microelectronics is an industry-wide challenge that they are working to confront. 
   
      ???TI is not selling any products into Russia, Belarus or Iran,??? Texas Instruments said in a statement. ??? TI complies with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, and partners with law enforcement organizations as necessary and appropriate. Additionally, we do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren???t designed for.???
   
      Gregor Rodehuser, a spokesperson for the German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon, told CNN that ???our position is very clear: Infineon condemns the Russian aggression against Ukraine. It is a blatant violation of international law and an attack on the values of humanity.??? He added that ???apart from the direct business it proves difficult to control consecutive sales throughout the entire lifetime of a product. Nevertheless, we instruct our customers including distributors to only conduct consecutive sales in line with applicable rules.???
   
      Analog Devices, a semiconductor company headquartered in Massachusetts, said in a statement that they are intensifying efforts ???to identify and counter this activity, including implementing enhanced monitoring and audit processes, and taking enforcement action where appropriate???to help to reduce unauthorized resale, diversion, and unintended misuse of our products.???  
   
      Jacey Zuniga, director of corporate communications for the Austin, Texas-based semiconductor company NXP USA, said that the company ???complies with all applicable export control restrictions and sanctions imposed by the countries in which we operate. Military applications are not a focus area for NXP. As a company, we are vehemently opposed to our products being used for human rights violations.??? 
   
      Phoenix, Arizona-based semiconductor manufacturing company Onsemi also said it complies with ???applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and does not sell directly or indirectly to Russia, Belarus or Iran nor to any foreign military organizations. We cooperate with law enforcement and government agencies as necessary and appropriate to demonstrate how Onsemi conducts business in accordance with all legal requirements and that we hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethical conduct.???
   
      Swiss semiconductor manufacturer U-Blox also said in a statement that its products are for commercial use only, and that the use of its products for Russian military equipment ???is in clear breach of u-blox???s conditions of sale applicable to customers and distributors alike.???

Here are the latest headlines: From CNN's Olga Voitovych in Kyiv Preparations for the transfer of a Patriot air defense battery from the United States are already underway, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “We look forward to the deployment of Patriot as soon as possible,” said Kuleba in a video?posted to Facebook on Wednesday. “Preparations for the transfer of these systems have already begun.”   President Joe Biden announced last month that the US would transfer a?Patriot air defense battery, along with munitions, to Ukraine. “Now President Zelensky and the entire diplomatic team are intensively working on new solutions for the supply of new types of Western weapons,” Kuleba said.  “First of all, we are talking about the supply of Western-style tanks and other armored vehicles. I have no doubt that the Ukrainian army will soon have additional armor and firepower." ? Continuing his criticism of Russian authorities, a top Russian military blogger has warned that apathy on the battlefield will lead to more “tragedies,” like the dozens and perhaps hundreds of Russian soldiers killed in a strike on occupied Makiivka over the weekend. Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias WarGonzo, said: “If you ask me personally what is the most dangerous thing in war, I will answer unequivocally: not to bother.”? “After ten months of the special military operation, it should be clear to even the most notorious slowpokes: this war cannot be won at random,”?he said.  Since the invasion began in February, Moscow has referred to the war as a “special military operation.” It was?his second lengthy post on Wednesday reflecting on an apparent Ukrainian strike this weekend, which the Russian Defense Ministry has now admitted killed 89 soldiers -- one of the most devastating single incidents for Moscow since its invasion.  In an earlier post on Wednesday, Pegov said that the lists of missing are “noticeably longer” than those already acknowledged by officials. Ukrainian authorities have claimed that up to 400 Russian soldiers were killed and 300 wounded. Russian President Vladimir Putin?personally awarded?Pegov with the Order of Courage at the Kremlin on December 20. Earlier Wednesday, Pegov warned that the “only cure” was to not lodge soldiers together in large buildings. “The banal thing is not to settle 500 people in one place, but to scatter them over ten different locations,” he said. “Yes, that takes a lot of work. But it's a matter of life and death.”  From CNN's Josh Pennington and Mick Krever   The head of Russia’s Wagner private military company has attempted to explain his group’s failure to capture the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which has for months been the scene of intense fighting. During a New Year’s visit with fighters on the front line,?Yevgeny Prigozhin said that there was “a fortress in every house” in Bakhmut, and that “only clowns that sit around and try to predict these things.” “Sometimes it takes entire weeks to clear a house, right?” he asked soldiers in?a video posted to a Wagner Telegram channel over the weekend.  “They say, ‘the combined forces have advanced into Artyomovsk and broken the defense,’” he said, referring to Bakhmut by its Soviet name. The name was changed back to Bakhmut in 2016. “Then they say: ‘What does it mean to “break through the defense?”’ ‘Breaking through the defense’ means breaking through the defense of one house this morning, then you have to go break the defense of the next house, right?" he said.  "And it’s not just one line of defense. How many lines of defense are there in Artyomovsk? If we said 500, that would be about accurate, right?” The fighters confirm that there is a Ukrainian line of defense “every 10 meters,” before Prigozhin continues. “Therefore the question is: “Who is going to take Artyomovsk? Which combined forces? It’ll be the Wagner combined forces,”?he said.?“And who else? Other than Wagner PMC, who else is there?” “No one else,” the soldiers said. Prigozhin denied any affiliation with Wagner for years, but in September finally admitted to founding the group in 2014. He has since appeared frequently on social media, attempting to fashion Wagner’s image as the most capable outfit in Russia’s war in Ukraine. “This year we will win! But first we will conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption,”?Prigozhin?says in another video.? “Once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world,” he adds. “The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption won’t listen to us because for New Year’s they are all drinking champagne.” From CNN's Olga Voitovych and Mick Krever A top Russian military blogger has railed against the Russian Ministry of Defense’s explanation of how dozens of soldiers were targeted in eastern Ukraine, calling the official story "not convincing" and "a blatant attempt to smear blame." Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias WarGonzo and was personally awarded?the Order of Courage by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on December 20, said that the death toll in Makiivka was likely far greater than the 89 now officially acknowledged by Russia. "The lists of the missing are, unfortunately, noticeably longer," he said. The Russian Ministry of Defense has appeared to blame the soldiers themselves for a Ukrainian strike on Russian-occupied Makiivka. It said the "main cause" of the incident was the widespread use of cell phones by Russian soldiers "contrary to the ban," which allowed Ukraine to "track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers' locations." On Wednesday Pegov said that, while the use of mobile phones near the front lines was "obviously" not a good thing, "the story with ‘mobiles’ is not too convincing." "This is not a personal opinion, it is objective," he said.  He questioned how the Ministry of Defense could be "so sure" that the location of soldiers lodging in a school building could not have been determined using drone surveillance, or a local informant. "Coordinates of objects are being leaked, and important people's movements are regularly ‘tipped off’ to the SBU," the?Security Service of Ukraine, he said.  "The network works, it does not sleep," said Pegov.  "Neither do Ukrainian drones in the skies above Donetsk and Makiivka, which can provide not just information about the accumulation of subscribers, but also confirm it visually." He also argued that Ukraine’s military would not use American-made HIMARS missiles unless it were certain of its target. "This is an expensive high-precision weapon. Before striking with HIMARS, the enemy obviously verifies the information," he said. Ukraine does not fire "just for luck." Pegov once again questioned the official Russian death toll, which was increased from 63 to 89 early Wednesday, already making it one of the most devastating single attacks against Russia in the war. "Unfortunately their number will still be growing," he said. "The figures are most likely for those who were able to be identified immediately." "I cannot reveal my sources, but I think they are reliable," added Pegov. "We double-checked them several times with the guys." From CNN's Olga Voitovych in Kyiv and Mick Krever   The leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday praised the bravery of Russian soldiers killed in a Ukrainian strike on the occupied city of Makiivka, even as the Russian Defense Ministry appeared to blame their cell phone use as “the main cause” of the attack. The Russian Defense Ministry earlier appeared to blame the soldiers themselves for the Ukrainian strike, saying “the main cause” of the incident was the widespread use of cell phones by Russian soldiers “contrary to the ban,” allowing Ukraine to “track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers' locations.”  Four rockets from US-made HIMARS launchers were used in the strike, killing a total of 89 servicemen, according to the ministry. Among them was the regiment's deputy commander, Lt. Col. Bachurin, the ministry said in a statement. Pushilin claimed Wednesday that “most of them barely made it out of the building that had been damaged by the American HIMARS, then came to their senses and went back to get their comrades out.” From CNN's Josh Pennington, Karen Smith and Philip Wang  The "mass use" of cell phones by military personnel was the "main cause" of the strike that killed scores of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine on New Year's Day, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday. The ministry said the use of cell phones by military personnel led to the detection of the location for the apparent Ukrainian strike. "A committee is currently working to investigate the circumstances of the incident. But it is already clear now that the main cause of the incident was the inclusion and mass use, contrary to the ban, of cell phones by military personnel within the range of the enemy's weapon systems," the ministry's statement said.  Four rockets from US-made HIMARS launchers were used in the strike in Makiivka, Donetsk, killing a total of 89 servicemen, according to the ministry.  The Ukrainian military has claimed up to around 400 Russian soldiers died in the strike CNN cannot independently verify either figure. From CNN's Josh Pennington and Mitchell McCluskey?   Four rockets from US-made HIMARS launchers were used in the deadly New Year's Day strike on Russian troops in the occupied city of Makiivka, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday.?? Two other HIMARS rockets were intercepted by manned air defense assets, the ministry said.? HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is a multiple launch rocket launcher made in the United States. Disputed death toll: The apparent Ukrainian strike took place just after midnight Sunday on a vocational school housing Russian conscripts in Makiivka, in the Donetsk region, according to both Ukrainian and pro-Russian accounts. The Ukrainian military claimed up to around 400 Russian soldiers died in the strike, while Russia's Defense Ministry has reported that 89 servicemen were killed.

      ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ露 thought I would die on that boatﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・ Mother recalls the horror of month adrift at sea
    
**************************
 
      Hatemon Nesa weeps as she clings to her 5-year-old daughter, Umme Salima, at a rescue shelter in Indonesia???s Aceh province. Their faces appear gaunt, their eyes sullen, after drifting for weeks at sea on a boat with little food or water. 
   
      ???My skin was rotting off and my bones were visible,??? Nesa said. ???I thought I would die on that boat.???
   
      Nesa also cries for her 7-year-old daughter, Umme Habiba, who she says she was forced to leave behind in Bangladesh ??? she couldn???t afford any more than the $1,000 the traffickers demanded to transport her and her youngest child to Malaysia. ???My heart is burning for my daughter,??? she said.
   
      Nesa and Umme Salima were among around 200 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, who embarked on the dangerous voyage in late November from Cox???s Bazar, a sprawling refugee camp in Bangladesh crowded with around a million people who fled alleged genocide by the Myanmar military.
   
      But soon after they left, the engine cut out, turning what was supposed to be a 7-day journey into a month-long ordeal at sea, exposed to the elements in the open-topped wooden boat, surviving only on rainwater and just three days??? worth of food.
   
      Nesa said she saw starving men jump overboard in a desperate search for food, but they never returned. And she witnessed a baby die after being fed salt water from the sea.
   
      As the weeks wore on, the passengers??? families and aid agencies pleaded with governments in multiple countries to help them ??? but their cries were ignored. 
   
      Then on December 26, the boat was rescued by Indonesian fishermen and local authorities in Aceh, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). Of the 200 or so people who boarded the boat, only 174 survived ??? around 26 died on the boat, or are missing at sea, presumed dead.
   
      Babar Baloch, an Asia spokesperson for the agency, said after a lull during Covid, the numbers of people fleeing are back to pre-Covid levels. Some 2,500 boarded unseaworthy boats last year for the journey, and as many as 400 of them died, making 2022 one of the deadliest years in a decade for Rohingya escaping Cox???s Bazar.
   
      ???These are literally death traps that once you get in ??? you end up losing your life,??? he said. 
   
      Nesa and Salima???s journey began on November 25 from the overcrowded refugee camps in Cox???s Bazar, where she said her children couldn???t go to school, leaving her with little hope for their future. 
   
      Nesa said she had carried around two kilograms of rice for the journey, but shortly after the boat left the port, its engine died and they started drifting. 
   
      ???Starving with no food, we saw a fishing boat nearby and tried to go close,??? she said, crying as she recalled the horror. ???We jumped in the water to swim close to that boat but in the end, we could not.???
   
      During December, as the boat bobbed aimlessly in the Bay of Bengal, the UNHCR said it was spotted near India and Sri Lanka. But the agency said those countries ???continuously ignored??? its pleas for intervention.
   
      CNN has contacted the Indian and Sri Lankan Navies for comment but has not received a response. Last month, the Sri Lankan Navy said in a statement that its crews had made a ???strenuous effort??? to rescue another boat carrying 104 Rohingya, including many women and children, who had fled Bangladesh. 
   
      On December 18, Nesa???s brother, Mohammed Rezuwan Khan, who is in Cox???s Bazar, shared with CNN an audio clip of a harrowing phone call he received from one of the refugees aboard Nesa???s boat. 
   
      ???We are dying here,??? the man said via satellite phone, according to the recording. ???We haven???t eaten anything for eight to 10 days. We are starving.??? 
   
      Nesa said the boat???s driver and another crew member jumped into the ocean to find food, but they never returned. ???I think they got eaten by fish in the sea,??? she said. 
   
      Twelve other men entered the water, while holding onto a long rope attached to the boat to try to catch something to eat, but as others on the boat tried to pull them back in, the rope snapped, Nesa said. ???They could not return to the boat.???
   
      While all countries are bound by international law to rescue people in distress at sea, swift action is not always forthcoming ??? particularly where Rohingya refugees are concerned, according to Baloch, from the UNHCR.
   
      ???I think everyone will agree as human beings that we have the responsibility you want to save one life in distress, let alone hundreds of people dying,??? Baloch said. ???(Nearby states) have to act to save these desperate people. It has to be an action which is in coordination done collectively by all the states in the region.??? 
   
      Nesa and Umme Salima were among the 174 emaciated survivors shown on video setting foot on land for the first time in weeks in late December, some immediately collapsing onto the sand of an Aceh beach, too weak to stand.
   
      They are among the more fortunate ones ??? the UNHCR believes another 180 are presumed dead, lost at sea on another boat since early December, when the occupants stopped communicating with their families.
   
      The survivors from Nesa???s boat are now receiving medical care in Aceh, however it remains unclear what might happen to them in the coming weeks and months.  
   
      Indonesia is not party to the UN Refugee Convention and lacks a national refugee protection structure, according to the UNHCR.
   
      For those found to be refugees, UNHCR will begin to look for one of a range of what solutions, including resettlement to a third country or voluntary repatriation, if a person is able to ???return in safety and dignity.??? 
   
      This marks the start of a new chapter for the group of passengers, who have lived for years in overcrowded, unhygienic and unsafe refugee camps in Bangladesh, after fleeing decades of systematic discrimination, widespread brutality and sexual violence in their home country of Myanmar. 
   
      ???Stateless, persecuted, these Rohingya refugees have known little peace,??? said UNHCR???s Baloch. 
   
      Much more needs to be done by the international community for the persecuted group, who suffer on a scale most cannot imagine, he added.
   
      For Nesa, the hope remains that she might be reunited with her other daughter some day. 
   
      ???I was about to die (in Bangladesh),??? she said. ???Allah gave me a new life ??? My children should get a proper education. That is all that I wanted.???

      McCarthy may have only himself to blame
    
**************************
 
      Governing by chaos is back.
   
      Two years after the master of political mayhem, ex-President Donald Trump, stormed out of Washington in disgrace, Republicans have finally won back some power. 
   
      But they still don???t know how to properly use it.
   
      After weeks of vowing to hold President Joe Biden to account, the new GOP House majority arrived in town Tuesday ??? and promptly failed in its most basic task: electing a speaker to lead it. A revolt of ultra-hardliners in an already hardline conference dealt humiliation to Kevin McCarthy, the California lawmaker who saw his decades-old dream of wielding the gavel dashed ??? at least for now.
   
      Trump, who is partly to blame for the debacle after contributing to a smaller-than-expected GOP House majority after his self-serving interventions in the midterm elections, called on holdouts Wednesday to get behind McCarthy.
   
      ???Republicans, do not turn a great triumph into a giant & embarrassing defeat,??? the ex-president wrote on his Truth Social platform in all-caps, saying McCarthy would do a good and ???maybe even a great job.???
   
      Many of the rebels are among Trump???s strongest supporters and McCarthy spoke to Trump on Tuesday night amid signs his support was beginning to fray.
   
      Even Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, known more for embracing conspiracy theories than stable governance, complained that the party was thwarting its own goals ???because 19 Republicans decided to blow up the Speaker???s race.??? (Greene backs McCarthy). 
   
      McCarthy became the first candidate to fall short in a first ballot for speaker in a century. Most poignantly, the impasse means Republicans are unable even to assume the control they won in the midterms as a new House can???t yet be sworn in.
   
      On a surreal day, the 118th Congress opened with Republicans fighting Republicans, while Democrats ??? who should have been mourning their lost majority ??? were joyous at the GOP circus they beheld. 
   
      ???Hakeem, Hakeem,??? Democrats chanted as their new leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, earned more votes than McCarthy in the first three roll calls of the new House the GOP is supposed to control ??? although he too fell short of the 218 majority. 
   
      At one point, Ohio firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan, a hero of the right, stood to nominate McCarthy for speaker, only for 19 of the rejectionists to vote that he should have the top job that he insists he doesn???t want. (Jordan is more interested in lacerating Biden???s appointees as chair of the Judiciary Committee).
   
      A daylong debacle, in which McCarthy appeared to have no strategy other than a beat-the-head-against-a-brick-wall approach, ended with the House in an absurd limbo. Smartly dressed family members who traveled to Washington to see their new lawmakers proudly sworn in were bored and disappointed. The House adjourned and will resume on Wednesday at noon, even though there???s little sign the deadlock will break.
   
      ???I didn???t think we were going to get any more productive by continuing on the day,??? McCarthy told reporters late Tuesday. But he insisted he wouldn???t be dropping out of the race. 
   
      ???It???s not going to happen,??? he said, adding, ???We only need 11 more votes to win,??? implying that he thinks he can get a number of members to vote present, which would lower the threshold he???d need.
   
      The picture will become clearer on Wednesday as the fourth vote looms, though a GOP source familiar with the matter tells CNN???s Manu Raju that it???s possible the House may adjourn to allow the talks to continue for the rest of the day.
   
      But there are some conclusions from Tuesday???s drama.
   
      ??? The GOP civil war, which erupted with the Tea Party backlash to the Obama administration, is far from burned out. It was responsible for the departures of Republican House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner and was put into overdrive by Trump. And as soon as the party had a sniff of power again, that strife burst into the open as radicals seek to destroy a party establishment that has already shifted far right to appease them.
   
      ??? Even if McCarthy prevails, he will be a weak speaker who may be in office but barely in power. The Californian had weeks to get his majority together. Either he inaccurately counted the votes or has no control over his conference. Neither scenario is likely to lead to a majority that effectively trains its fire on Democrats and the White House and can build a strong case for voters for the 2024 election. If Republicans can???t unite on an easy vote ??? for speaker ??? how will they come together on tough ones, on government spending bills, for example?
   
      ??? Political arsonists cannot be won over. Leadership sources say Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona and other members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus were offered multiple concessions by McCarthy, including weakening the speaker???s capacity to cling on to power. But they refused, making clear that this is as much about personalities as ideology. They brand McCarthy as a sell-out, the biggest alligator in the Washington ???swamp??? whom they will never trust. 
   
      ???Maybe the right person for the speaker of the House isn???t someone who has sold shares in himself for more than a decade to get it,??? Gaetz said on the floor on Tuesday in a cutting jab at McCarthy, who sat a few feet away. 
   
      ??? McCarthy may have nothing to offer the renegades to win their votes. They disdain big committee posts and don???t dream of passing signature bills. They don???t care that a majority of the GOP in the House wants McCarthy. For them, as it was for Trump, the chaos is the point. Taking on the ???swamp??? gets them booked on conservative talk shows, boosts their fundraising and polishes their MAGA credentials. 
   
      Former Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state ??? who voted to impeach Trump, lost a primary to a rival backed by the ex-president, who then went on to lose the general election to a Democrat ??? told CNN???s Jake Tapper Tuesday the rebels were in it for themselves.
   
      ???It???s just drama. ??? They have this outsize platform,??? she said. ???It???s just ridiculous.???
   
      ??? The tiny Republican majority ??? which means McCarthy could only afford to lose four votes for speaker ??? will dominate the 118th Congress. It not only gave the hardliners the chance to hold McCarthy hostage in the race for speaker; it will mean that at any moment, the House can be shut down over just a few votes. This isn???t just a concern for the eventual speaker. The White House should be worried too, given looming showdowns over government budgets and raising the debt ceiling. 
   
      Ironically, McCarthy may have only himself to blame. By quickly embracing Trump after initially criticizing him over the January 6, 2021, insurrection, he linked his party???s midterm election campaign irrevocably to Trump???s reputation. But many voters were alienated by the ex-president???s election denialism and landed McCarthy with a much smaller and more unworkable House majority than he expected.
   
      ??? One interpretation of the midterms was that voters ??? exhausted by the turbulence of the Trump years and a once-in-a-century pandemic ??? gave a cry for stability and calm and were therefore not willing to hand all the power available in November back to Republicans. (While they fell short of a red wave in the House, the GOP failed to win back the Senate and Democrats grew their majority). Farcical scenes in the House on Tuesday were hardly what those voters had in mind in November.
   
      ??? And Democrats are already trying to make political capital out of it, seeing vindication for their claims that Republicans are still not fit for power and should be kicked out at the first opportunity in the next election. ???I just watched House Republicans plunge into utter chaos on the House floor,??? Jeffries told Democratic donors in a fundraising email. ???This changes everything for Democrats. We now have a huge opportunity to step in and show what we can do.???
   
      If anything, McCarthy got weaker with each roll call, even if one senior GOP source told CNN he would never back down and ???we???re going to war.??? Some GOP members are now referring to the rebels as ???the chaos caucus??? or ???The Taliban 20,??? CNN???s Manu Raju reported. 
   
      But one lawmaker who opposed McCarthy, South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, vowed he???d fight on for ???six months??? if need be to thwart the Californian???s bid for speaker. Despite the tough talk, McCarthy ??? who rather prematurely took up residence in the speaker???s office suite ??? is left with painful realities. They include the question of whether his bid is doomed, given that it seems impossible that he can win over the most hardline handful of objectors. A few Republicans late Tuesday seemed to be toying with the possibility that another candidate could emerge ??? after the House turned into a farce and their party was made a laughing stock.
   
      But the chances of a compromise choice who could unite the ultra-right and more moderate members who won in Biden districts seems remote.
   
      McCarthy will get a fresh chance on Wednesday to show that he can bring his conference under control and finally bring some order to the new Republican majority ??? even if the path ahead remains impossible to identify. Perhaps a day of infighting will convince all Republicans they are at risk of squandering their majority.
   
      ???We have an agenda and we want to implement that agenda and we can either be the conference who comes together to do that or we can let a select few keep us from being able to do that,??? Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore told CNN???s Erin Burnett on Tuesday, arguing that McCarthy had been successful in leading his party back to power in the House. 
   
      ???You don???t take out a pitcher in the middle of a no-hitter,??? he added.
   
      But after his triple loss in votes for speaker Tuesday, McCarthy must now prove it???s not three strikes and you are out.

      Israelﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 rightward shift leaves its new Arab allies in an awkward spot
    
**************************
 
  Editor???s Note: A version of this story appears in today???s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN???s three-times-a-week look inside the region???s biggest stories. Sign up here.
 
      It was a rare embrace between one of Israel???s most controversial politicians and an Arab ambassador. Itamar Ben Gvir and the United Arab Emirates??? Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja clutched each other???s hands in a warm greeting in Tel Aviv in early December.   
   
      ???Birds of a feather flock together,??? wrote a columnist in Israel???s left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, arguing that the Abraham Accords, which saw Israel gain recognition from four Arab states including the UAE in 2020, did little to moderate Israel???s position on the Palestinians. Ben Gvir, he said, was ???a superstar in the UAE.???   
   
      Israel on Thursday swore in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history, led by six-time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, became national security minister. Bezalel Smotrich, who supports abolishing the Palestinian Authority and annexing the West Bank, became finance minister.   
   
      Both politicians were invited to national day celebrations in December hosted by the UAE and Bahrain, which were among the nations that normalized relations with Israel, along with Morocco and Sudan in 2020.    
   
      ???The Emirates are here to show that unity equals prosperity,??? Al Khaja was cited by the Times of Israel as saying at his country???s national day celebration, where he was photographed with Ben Gvir. ???We will continue to use diplomacy to deepen connections through friendship and mutual respect.???   
   
      The public embrace of figures that are hated in the Arab world ??? and are divisive within Israel itself ??? is a rare gesture on the part of Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel.    
   
      Egypt and Jordan, who recognized Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively, have had what observers have called a ???cold peace??? with Israel.   
   
      
      How the UAE went from boycotting Israel to investing billions in its economy
     
      In his phone call to congratulate Netanyahu on returning as prime minister, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ???emphasized the need to avoid any measures that would lead to tension and complicate the regional situation.??? Jordan???s King Abdullah II warned in a CNN interview last month that his nation was ???prepared??? for conflict should the situation change at Jerusalem???s al-Aqsa mosque, of which he is the custodian.   
   
      The rightward direction of Israeli politics puts Israel???s new Arab partners in an awkward position regarding the Palestinian cause, which remains a central issue among Arab publics.    
   
      ???It is awkward not just for us (in the UAE), but for everybody, in America, and all over the place,??? Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political science professor in the UAE, told CNN. ???It is a dilemma, but the way to deal with it is just to wait and see.???   
   
      An opinion poll by The Washington Institute for Near East Policy in July 2022 showed that support for the Abraham Accords had dropped in Gulf countries to a minority view, including the UAE and Bahrain, where more than 70% of the public views the agreement negatively. The data however also showed that around 40% of people in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain support maintaining business and sporting ties with Israel.   
   
      The normalizing states appear to be cognizant of that. On Friday, all four Arab states continued the tradition of supporting the Palestinians at the United Nations by voting at the General Assembly to seek the International Criminal Court???s opinion on the legal consequences of Israel???s occupation of Palestinian territories. Netanyahu called the vote ???despicable.???   
   
      But Israeli media has reported that behind the scenes, the Emiratis have also been sending messages of concern to Netanyahu about the inclusion of extremists in his government. Ahead of the Israeli elections, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah Bin Zayed warned Netanyahu against including Ben Gvir and Smotrich in his government, the Times of Israel reported, citing a senior official. Axios, which first reported the news, said Netanyahu didn???t respond.   
   
      The move would be a rare case of one of Israel???s Arab partners showing a preference for the country???s domestic politics.    
   
      The UAE foreign ministry didn???t respond to CNN???s request for comment. 
   
      Israeli analyst Zvi Bar???el wrote in Haaretz that the December move to embrace Ben Gvir may have been linked to Abu Dhabi???s desire to steer Israeli policy, adding that it made the UAE ???the Arab country with the greatest influence on the new Israeli government.???   
   
      The effectiveness of the UAE???s diplomacy within Israel remains to be seen. So far, Israel???s extremist minister seems unrestrained.   
   
      
      Jordan king warns of 'red lines' in Jerusalem as Netanyahu returns to office
     
      Less than a week since he was sworn in, Ben Gvir made a controversial visit to the al-Aqsa mosque compound escorted by Israeli police on Tuesday. The mosque, which lies in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, is in an area known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. It is the third holiest site for Muslims and the holiest for Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount. Under current arrangements, non-Muslims aren???t allowed to pray there and Ben Gvir wants to change that.   
   
      The UAE ???strongly??? condemned Ben Gvir???s visit without naming the minister, and called for the need to respect Jordan???s custodianship of the holy site. It later joined China in calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on the matter.   
   
      ???However unhappy they (Bahrain and the UAE) might be towards the emergence of Israel???s most right-wing government, it???s clear that they???ve chosen to air these concerns privately, and have stopped short of letting them stand in the way of what they see as an important strategic relationship,??? Elham Fakhro, a research fellow at the Centre for Gulf Studies at the University of Exeter, England, told CNN.   
   
      But the UAE has said earlier that the more friendly ties with the Arab world weren???t a green light for Israel to expand its territory. In June 2020, Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, warned Israel that its relations with Arab nations would suffer if there is any ???illegal seizure of Palestinian land.???   
   
      Abdullah, the professor from the UAE, said that Abu Dhabi may have some leverage over Israel that it may use privately at times, but added that ultimately ???everybody knows that nobody today has any leverage over Israel. Even America.???   
   
      Still, the UAE-Israel relationship is not everlasting, he said. ???This relationship is going to be dictated by the UAE??? When it doesn???t serve the interest of the UAE??? it can collapse at any time.???

      Soccer fans in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are celebrating the arrival of famed Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo in Riyadh, who touched down in the kingdom on Tuesday ahead of his unveiling ceremony with the Al Nassr Football Club.  
   
      Twitter was flooded with images of Ronaldo wearing the club???s yellow and blue colors, smiling on large billboards in the Saudi capital. Memes showed ???sheikh Ronaldo??? dressed in Arab attire, and another showed him wearing a jersey with the ???Just do it??? slogan for his sponsor Nike crossed out and replaced with ???inshallah??? ??? God-willing in Arabic.   
   
      A magazine in Saudi Arabia even put out ads for a full-time ???Ronaldo correspondent,??? Esquire magazine reported. 
   
      ???Welcome to the greatest player in the world,??? tweeted one Saudi user, sharing a video of a framed photograph of Ronaldo holding his Al Nassr jersey.  
   
      ???The streets of Riyadh welcome Ronaldo,??? tweeted one Kuwaiti social media influencer, saying Saudis are lucky their country has become home to such a high-status player. 
   
      The celebrations quickly faded for some, however, when a video showing Ronaldo mistakenly refer to his new home as ???South Africa??? on Tuesday went viral. ???So, for me it???s not the end of my career to come in South Africa. This is why I wanna change. And to be honest I don???t really worry about what the people say,??? the soccer star said at a press conference in Riyadh on Tuesday. 
   
      Some joked that Ronaldo accepted a large sum to play in Saudi Arabia only to get the country???s name wrong.  
   
      Al Nassr FC announced on December 30 that the footballer was joining their team, tweeting a photo of Ronaldo in its jersey. The 37-year-old was a free agent and immediately available due to his high-profile break-up with Manchester United last month.

      Indians demand justice for Delhi woman dragged to her death
    
**************************
 
      Angry crowds gathered in Delhi on Tuesday, demanding justice for a scooter rider who was killed and dragged by a car for miles through the streets of India???s capital.
   
      Delhi police said the 20-year-old woman???s scooter collided with the car in the early hours of January 1 before her body was pulled for up to 12 kilometers (more than 7 miles).
   
      ???We have information that the girl???s body was stuck in the car somehow and was dragged for about 10-12 kilometers,??? Delhi police official Sagar Hooda told a news conference Monday. ???Then at a turning, the body was dropped from the car.???
   
      Five people have been arrested in connection with the incident, Hooda said. 
   
      A witness who was with the victim at the time of the collision is cooperating with police, he added.
   
      ???She was not injured and she left the site of the accident,??? he said, referring to the witness. ???The investigation is ongoing ??? we are looking at multiple angles and will soon complete it and the accused will get the strictest punishment possible.???
   
      The woman???s body was badly mutilated, with her torn clothes found near her body, according to Harendra Singh, a senior Delhi police official. 
   
      ???The back of the head and her back were destroyed because of being dragged for so long,??? he said. 
   
      The grisly details have sparked outrage in India, with headlines dominating prime time news and many taking to the streets to demand strict punishment for the alleged perpetrators. On Monday, hundreds gathered outside a police station in the district where the incident took place. 
   
      Senior politicians have also called for an investigation.
   
      ???My head hangs in shame over the inhuman crime,??? Delhi???s Lt. Gov. Vinai Saxena wrote on Twitter Monday. ???I am shocked at the monstrous insensitivity of the perpetrators ??? All aspects are being thoroughly looked into.??? 
   
      Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi???s chief minister, said he had asked authorities ???to take exemplary action against culprits.???  
   
      Road accidents are common in India, where drivers often break traffic rules and safety regulations are not always strictly enforced. 
   
      In 2021, nearly 154,000 deaths were recorded on India???s roads, according to the Transport Ministry. Meanwhile, nearly 58,000 hit-and-run incidents were reported nationwide.

      Videos show both sides of US-China aerial encounter ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・and highlight the risks involved
    
**************************
 
  Editor???s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN???s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country???s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.
 
      The interception of a United States Air Force reconnaissance jet by a Chinese fighter over the South China Sea last month should be seen as a potential warning of how easily, and quickly things can go terribly wrong ??? raising the risk of a deadly military confrontation between the two powers, analysts say.
   
      The incident in question occurred on December 21 over the northern part of the South China Sea in what the US says was international airspace.
   
      Performing what the US military deemed an ???unsafe maneuver,??? a Chinese navy J-11 fighter jet flew within 20 feet of the nose of a US RC-135 Rivet Joint, an unarmed reconnaissance plane with about 30 people on board, forcing the US plane to take ???evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision,??? according to a statement from the US Indo-Pacific Command issued on December 28.
   
      It released a video of the incident showing the Chinese fighter flying to the left of and slightly above the four-engine US jet, similar to the Boeing 707 airliners of the 1960s and ???70s, and then gradually closing in on its nose before moving away.
   
      The People???s Liberation Army???s Southern Theater Command, in a report on China Military Online, had a different interpretation of the encounter, saying it was the US jet that ???abruptly changed its flight attitude and forced the Chinese aircraft to the left.???
   
      ???Such a dangerous approaching maneuver seriously affected the flight safety of the Chinese military aircraft,??? it said.
   
      It released its own video of the incident, shot from the fighter jet, that appeared to show the RC-135 moving closer to and behind the fighter.
   
      Aviation and military experts contacted by CNN who watched the two videos said it appeared the Chinese jet was firmly in the wrong and had no reason to get as close as it did to the American plane.
   
      ???The 135 was in international airspace and is a large, slow, non-maneuverable aircraft. It is the responsibility of the approaching smaller, fast, maneuverable aircraft to stay clear, not to cause a problem for both aircraft,??? said Peter Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer, now with the Griffith Asia Institute.
   
      ???The intent of the interception was presumably to visually identify the aircraft and the fighter could have stayed several miles away and competed that task. Getting closer brings no gains,??? he said.
   
      Robert Hopkins, a retired US Air Force officer who flew similar reconnaissance jets, also pushed back at the Chinese interpretation of events.
   
      ???The (Chinese) response is so far divorced from reality that it is fictional. An unarmed, airliner-sized aircraft does not aggressively turn into a nimble armed fighter,??? said Hopkins.
   
      But Hopkins also said the US military risked blowing the incident out of proportion in saying the US jet had to take ???evasive maneuvers,??? a term he described as ???overly dramatic.???
   
      ???These are no different than a driver adjusting her position to avoid a temporary lane incursion by an adjacent driver,??? Hopkins said. ???The US response is pure theater and needlessly creates an exaggerated sense of danger.???
   
      But while the incident itself was safely managed by the US pilots, experts agreed the small distance between the US and Chinese planes evident in the videos leaves little room for error.
   
      ???Flying aircraft close to each other at 500 miles per hour with unfriendly intentions is generally unsafe,??? said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.
   
      ???At that range, an unexpected maneuver or an equipment issue can cause a terrible accident in under a second,??? Herzinger said.
   
      
      US and China in first South China Sea encounter since Xi-Biden meeting
     
      And Herzinger said the current state of US-China military relations means accidents could quickly turn into armed confrontation.
   
      ???It???s worth remembering that the PLA has effectively wrecked any kind of hotlines or discussion forums for addressing potential incidents with the United States. If an intercept does go wrong, there are fewer options than ever for senior officers to limit potential escalation,??? he said.
   
      Layton pointed out another potential danger that could lead to escalation. As seen in the US video, the Chinese aircraft is armed with air-to-air missiles.
   
      ???The 135 is an unarmed aircraft. Why does the PLAN consider it necessary to intercept carrying missiles when the intent was to visually identify the aircraft? Doing this is potentially dangerous and could lead to a major and tragic incident,??? Layton said.
   
      But in a regular press briefing on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the incident was just the latest in a string of US provocations that threaten stability in the region.
   
      ???Let me point out that for a long time, the US has frequently deployed aircraft and vessels for close-in reconnaissance on China, which poses a serious danger to China???s national security,??? Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.
   
      The Chinese Southern Theater Command said the US reconnaissance jet was flying ???in the vicinity of China???s southern coastline and the Xisha Islands??? ??? known in the West as the Paracels ??? where Beijing has built up military installations.
   
      The US Indo-Pacfic Command said the RC-135 was in international airspace and was ???lawfully conducting routine operations.??? 
   
      China claims almost all of the vast South China Sea as part of its territorial waters, including many distant islands and inlets in the disputed body of water, many of which Beijing has militarized.
   
      
      Why Chinese warplanes are 'playing chicken' with US allies 
     
      The US does not recognize these territorial claims and routinely conducts operations there, including freedom of navigation operations through the South China Sea. 
   
      ???The US???s provocative and dangerous moves are the root cause of maritime security issues. China urges the US to stop such dangerous provocations, and stop deflecting blame on China,??? the Foreign Ministry???s Wang said.
   
      But Washington has consistently pointed the finger back at China in these intercepts, which date back decades.
   
      In the most infamous incident in 2001, a Chinese fighter jet collided with a US reconnaissance plane near Hainan Island in the northern South China Sea, leading to a major crisis as the Chinese pilot was killed and the damaged US plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The US crew was released after 11 days of intense negotiations.
   
      After a string of incidents last year involving intercepts of US and allied aircraft by Chinese warplanes, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the PLA???s  actions were escalating and ???should worry us all.???
   
      Layton said he thinks Beijing may have been trying to provoke the US military last month, and get it on video.
   
      ???There was no possible gain by the fighter flying so close except to create an incident ??? that was handily recorded on a high quality video camera the fighter???s crew just happened to have and be using. The incident seems very well planned by the PLAN, if rather risky,??? he said.

      Damar Hamlinﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 doctors are working to get him breathing without a ventilator after his mid-game cardiac arrest left him in critical condition
    
**************************
 
      After suffering a cardiac arrest mid-game on Monday, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin remains sedated on a ventilator as doctors work toward getting him to breathe on his own, his uncle said, while uneasy supporters across the nation await word of his fate.
   
      The 24-year-old player still was in critical condition Tuesday night, his uncle Dorrian Glenn told CNN, after his collapse on the field the prior night halted the Bills game against the Cincinnati Bengals, stunning a packed stadium that had only moments earlier been rippling with excitement over the catch and run ahead of Hamlin???s tackle of a Bengals wide receiver.
   
      FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES
   
      In just seconds, medical personnel were rushing onto the field to administer CPR and resuscitate Hamlin in front of his teammates, many of whom fell to their knees, sent up a prayer or were openly weeping and embracing one another. 
   
      
      Hamlin would be resuscitated twice that night ??? once on the field and again when he was hurried into the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was still being treated Tuesday night, his uncle said.
   
      ???I???m not a crier, but I???ve never cried so hard in my life. Just to know, like, my nephew basically died on the field and they brought him back to life,??? Glenn said.
   
      Hamlin is on a ventilator to relieve some of the strain on his lungs, which have been damaged, according to Glenn. The doctors told Glenn his nephew has also been ???flipped over on his stomach??? in the hospital to help with the blood on his lungs, he said, adding, ???It seems like he???s trending upwards in a positive way.???
   
      The game was suspended with nearly six minutes left in the first quarter and was later officially postponed. It will not be resumed this week, and no decision has been made on whether to continue it at a later date, the NFL said Tuesday.
   
      On-field injuries are not uncommon in the league, which often resumes play even after severe cases. But several current and former players have said Hamlin???s cardiac arrest felt especially disturbing as medical personnel fought to save his life while fans and players looked on.
   
      
      Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin was cherishing every moment in the NFL before his collapse
     
      Bills offensive tackle Dion Dawkins realized the gravity of his teammate???s condition when Hamlin stayed on the ground as more and more medical staff were called over, he said.
   
      ???In that moment, you???re just thinking like, ???What can I do? What can we do???? And it just immediately breaks you down into prayer,??? Dawkins told CNN???s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. ???Whether you???re a believer or not, only a higher power can really take control of what is next. And our people that help also assisted that higher power.???
   
      Hamlin???s collapse marks the latest in a series of tragic blows for the players and Buffalo community, which in the past few months has endured a racist mass shooting and a historic blizzard that left at least 41 people dead in Erie County, New York. ???It has been, you know, just (a) constant beating for Buffalo,??? Dawkins said. 
   
      A swell of support has surrounded Hamlin and his family as messages of prayers and well wishes have flooded in from star athletes, fans and national leaders. A fundraiser that Hamlin previously had started for his Chasing M???s Foundation toy drive has raised more than $6 million since his hospitalization. 
   
      At a prayer service for the player Tuesday night, community members described the heartbreak of watching ???one of our own??? endure such a crisis. 
   
      ???All you can do right now is pray for Damar. The man, not the football player, not the Buffalo Bill, but the person. He has to pull through,??? the city???s poet laureate Jillian Hanesworth said. 
   
      It is still unclear what led to Hamlin???s cardiac arrest ??? a condition that results from electrical disturbances that cause the heart to suddenly stop beating properly. Death can occur quickly if help isn???t rendered immediately. It is not the same as a heart attack or heart failure.
   
      When the heart is not beating well, fluid can sometimes back up into the lungs and make it hard for medical staff to oxygenate the patient, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explained. So, they will flip the person on their stomach into a prone position to make breathing easier.
   
      
      What are cardiac arrest, heart attack and heart failure?
     
      It sounds like Hamlin is still having a significant amount of cardiac dysfunction and his heart cannot pump enough blood, Gupta said.
   
      One of the treatment options is to decrease the body???s demand for oxygenated blood, he told CNN???s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday.
   
      ???So, you want to improve the amount of circulation, but in the interim, you can also decrease the demand by sedating somebody, by keeping them on a breathing machine,??? he said. ???Sometimes they???ll even use cooling agents, hypothermia it???s called, to basically almost put the body in more of a hibernation-like state so it???s not demanding as much oxygenated blood. That???s part of the reason he would be on a breathing machine as well.???
   
      Hamlin???s family on Tuesday thanked the UC Medical Center staff ???who have provided exceptional care to Damar.???
   
      ???On behalf of our family, we want to express our sincere gratitude for the love and support shown to Damar during this challenging time. We are deeply moved by the prayers, kind words, and donations from fans around the country,??? its statement said. 
   
      Several star athletes ??? including tennis player Coco Gauff, the NFL???s JJ Watt and NBA legend LeBron James ???  have applauded the NFL???s decision to postpone the game and have emphasized the importance of Hamlin???s safe recovery over the game???s outcome
   
      Former NFL player Dont?? Stallworth said the league???s decision to postpone the game wouldn???t have happened years ago. ???Five, 10 years ago, the game probably would have resumed,??? he told CNN???s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday. 
   
      ???I don???t know if you can make the game any much safer,??? he said. ???This is a brutal sport. I think people forget that. They look at players more as commodities sometimes, especially with fantasy football. 
   
      ???Sometimes we forget the human side, that these players are actually human beings and they have families and they have wives and kids,??? he added, pointing out that Hamlin???s ???mother was there witnessing this with her own eyes.???
   
      Dawkins was relieved and grateful that his team did not have to continue playing, he said.
   
      
      Opinion: The question we can't avoid after what happened to Damar Hamlin
     
      ???The fact that we did not have to go back out there on that field and play just shows that there is care, and that???s all we can ever ask for is that we get treated as people,??? he said. ???Because most people just treat us as athletes, as superstars, and some people like celebrities, but in that moment they treated us like people.???
   
      Bills players and staff are still processing Monday night???s events, a source within the team told CNN???s Coy Wire on Tuesday. 
   
      The continued shock of Hamlin???s hospitalization ??? on top of the city???s mass shooting in May, deadly December blizzard, having a home game in November moved to Detroit and getting stuck in Chicago during the holidays ??? has been heavy on everyone associated with the club, the source said.
   
      ???Everyone is exhausted,??? the source told Wire, adding that the team???s flight back to New York didn???t land until 3:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
   
  CNN???s Adrienne Broaddus reported from Cincinnati and Amanda Watts reported from Atlanta while Elizabeth Wolfe reported and wrote from Los Angeles. CNN???s David Close, Homero De la Fuente, Jason Hanna, Steve Almasy, Wayne Sterling, Laura Ly, Jamiel Lynch and Kevin Dotson also contributed to this report.

      Inflation fears fade as geopolitical risks rise

            Latest Market News 
	

 
  A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business??? Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up??right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.
 
      Inflation fears roiled the markets in 2022. Now, investors may have scarier things to worry about in 2023, according to a report from global research and consulting firm Eurasia Group. Most notable? Concerns about the increasingly chaotic geopolitical landscape.
   
      ???Inflation shockwaves??? still feature as one of Eurasia???s top political risks for 2023 in a new report. 
   
      But perhaps surprisingly, inflation ranks fourth on the list, behind worries about a rogue Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping???s consolidation of power in China. 
   
      Eurasia???s third biggest fear ??? the increased use of artificial intelligence technology to wreak havoc on the global economy ??? only adds to jitters about disruption from Russia and China. Eurasia called AI ???a gift to autocrats.???
   
      Eurasia, led by political scientist and author Ian Bremmer, pointed out that Russia???s war with Ukraine may become an even bigger problem for the United States and Europe. 
   
      
      Europe's big question: What a diminished Russia will do next
     
      ???Nuclear saber-rattling by Moscow will intensify. Putin???s threats will become more explicit,??? Eurasia said in its report. It is also concerned that ???Kremlin-affiliated hackers will ramp up cyberattacks on Western firms and governments.??? 
   
      That could mean attempts to disrupt oil pipelines, American and European satellites and other telecom and tech infrastructure, as well as further efforts to influence and sabotage global elections.
   
      ???Moscow will step up its rogue behavior???with newly empowered influence operations targeting NATO countries,??? Eurasia said in the report. 
   
      Eurasia pointed to upcoming Polish elections in 2023 as ???the most obvious target??? but that other Western nations ???will be vulnerable, too.??? 
   
      Autocracy in China is a potential economic and market headache as well.
   
      ???Xi???s drive for state control will produce arbitrary decisions and policy volatility. China???s economy is in a fragile state after two years of harsh Covid-19 controls,??? Eurasia noted, pointing out that ???plummeting homebuyer and market sentiment have ground growth in the critical real estate sector to a halt, depleting local government revenue.???
   
      Eurasia added that the ???backdrop of weakening global growth and deepening domestic challenges demands competent economic management from Beijing.??? Instead, ???the Chinese leadership is delivering opacity and unpredictability.???
   
      Chinese officials announced in October that they were delaying the release of key economic data, news that Eurasia said ???was an ominous sign of things to come for global markets.??? 
   
      
      From the unwinding of zero-Covid to economic recovery: What to watch in China in 2023
     
      All of this uncertainty comes as China continues to face the growing Covid outbreak in the country. Eurasia fears that ???if a severe new strain of Covid were to emerge,??? it is ???more likely that it would spread widely in China and beyond.
   
      ???China would be unlikely to identify the new variant because of reduced testing and sequencing, to recognize more severe disease due to an overwhelmed health system, and to let news of a more severe variant get out given Xi???s track record on transparency,??? Eurasia said. ???The world would have little or no time to prepare for a deadlier virus.???
   
      Meanwhile, Eurasia also is worried that Beijing ???will deploy new technologies not only to tighten surveillance and control of its own society, but also to spread propaganda on social media and intimidate Chinese language communities overseas.???
   
      None of this is to suggest that worries about rising prices have dissipated. 
   
      While inflation is listed as the fourth-biggest risk, Eurasia is still concerned that ???rising interest rates and global recession will raise the risk of emerging-market crises.??? 
   
      Energy prices in particular will remain a sticking point for the global markets and economy as Eurasia notes that ???higher oil prices will also increase frictions between OPEC+ and the United States.???
   
      
      Fed watch 2023: When will rate hikes slow down
     
      And Eurasia also listed concerns about instability in Iran, shrinking water levels and economic inequality as major global challenges. 
   
      Then there???s another new and distinctly 21st century worry: the rise of social media.
   
      ???Gen Z has both the ability and the motivation to organize online to reshape corporate and public policy, making life harder for multinationals everywhere and disrupting politics with the click of a button,??? Eurasia said, referring to the phenomenon as the ???Tik Tok Boom.???
   
      Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, had another day in court on Tuesday.
   
      Bankman-Fried, more commonly referred to by his initials, SBF, plead ???not guilty??? to charges ranging from wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering to conspiracy by misusing customer funds. 
   
      SBF appeared in a Manhattan court Tuesday after he was arrested last month in the Bahamas, extradited to the United States and then released by a judge on a $250 million bail package. But as my colleague Kara Scannell reports, the legal drama for SBF is only beginning. The judge set a trial date of October 2.
   
      
      Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed $546 million from his hedge fund to buy a Robinhood stake
     
      Prosecutors allege that SBF was in charge of ???one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.??? They claim that he moved (or stole) billions of dollars from FTX customers to cover losses at the firm???s companion hedge fund, Alameda Research.
   
      The cryptocurrency world was already in turmoil before FTX imploded. The prices of bitcoin, ethereum and other digital coins all plummeted in 2022. But FTX and Alameda were each forced to file for bankruptcy in December after investors rushed to pull deposits. 
   
      FTX was once valued at $32 billion, based on funding from private investors. The company was expected to be one of the hottest initial public offerings of 2023 as recently as the middle of last year. Not any more.
   
      Covid woes hurt Apple
            
                (AAPL) last year, as the world???s largest iPhone factory in China faced production disruptions since October due to the pandemic.
   
      But the giant campus, owned by top Apple supplier Foxconn, is reportedly now back at 90% production capacity following worker protests and Covid-related restrictions. 
   
      Apple needs to get more of its latest smartphones into people???s pockets. Delays with the various iPhone 14 models have cost the company ??? and its investors ??? dearly.
   
      
      Apple made China the backbone of its iPhone assembly. Shifting away could take years 
     
      Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimated in November that disruptions in China led to about $1 billion a week in lost revenue. 
   
      And analysts at UBS also said in November that wait times for the new iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max in the US were more than a month long due to supply chain woes. That couldn???t have come at a worse time since it was just before Christmas and other winter holidays. 
   
      Apple???s stock had a tough 2022, like the rest of Big Tech, and it didn???t start off 2023 in a festive fashion either. Shares of Apple hit a new 52-week low Tuesday. Apple???s market value dipped below $2 trillion in the process. Just a year ago, Apple was the first company in the world to reach a $3 trillion market valuation.

      Poland says Germany refused talks on World War II reparations
    
**************************
 
      Germany has rebuffed the latest push by Poland???s nationalist government for vast reparations over World War II, saying in response to a diplomatic note that the issue was closed, the foreign ministry in Warsaw said on Tuesday.
   
      A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said it had responded to a letter sent by Poland on the subject in October and did not comment on the contents of diplomatic correspondence.
   
      Poland estimates its World War II losses caused by Germany at $1.4 trillion and has demanded reparations, but Berlin has repeatedly said all financial claims related to the war have been settled.
   
      ???This answer, to sum it up, shows an absolutely disrespectful attitude towards Poland and Poles,??? Arkadiusz Mularczyk, Poland???s deputy foreign minister, said in an interview with the Polish Press Agency.
   
      
      Poland puts its World War II losses at $1.3 trillion, demands German reparations
     
      ???Germany does not pursue a friendly policy towards Poland, they want to build their sphere of influence here and treat Poland as a vassal state.???
   
      When asked about further dialog with Germany regarding compensation, Mularczyk said it would continue ???through international organizations.???
   
      Some six million Poles, including three million Polish Jews, were killed during the war and Warsaw was razed to the ground following a 1944 uprising in which about 200,000 civilians died.
   
      In 1953, Poland???s then-communist rulers relinquished all claims to war reparations under pressure from the Soviet Union, which wanted to free East Germany, also a Soviet satellite, from any liabilities.
   
      
      German President asks for forgiveness 80 years after start of World War II
     
      Poland???s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party says that agreement is invalid because Poland was unable to negotiate fair compensation. It has revived calls for compensation since it took power in 2015 and has made the promotion of Poland???s wartime victimhood a central plank of its appeal to nationalism.
   
      The combative stance toward Germany, often used by PiS to mobilize its constituency, has strained relations with Berlin.
   
      In a joint press conference with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau last October, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the pain caused by Germany during World War II was ???passed on through generations??? in Poland but that the issue of reparations was closed.

      Aldi sales soar as UK shoppers battle record food inflation

      Aldi recorded its highest-ever December sales in the United Kingdom, as shoppers squeezed by searing food price inflation flocked to the German discount supermarket chain to save money on groceries. 
   
      Sales topped ?￡1.4 billion ($1.7 billion) for the first time, up 26% year on year, with the FIFA World Cup also boosting purchases, Aldi said in a statement on Tuesday.
   
      Together, customers bought more than 48 million mince pies, 38 million pigs-in-blankets and more than 1,700 tonnes of Brussels sprouts in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
   
      Soaring food prices and wages that are failing to keep pace with inflation mean more UK shoppers are switching to discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, as well as trading down to supermarkets??? own label products.
   
      The British Retail Consortium said Wednesday that food inflation accelerated to 13.3% in December, up from 12.4% in November, the highest level recorded since it started tracking the data in 2005. Fresh food inflation accelerated to 15% in December, also an all-time high. 
   
      ???2023 will be another difficult year for consumers and businesses as inflation shows no immediate signs of waning,??? BRC CEO Helen Dickinson said in a statement.
   
      Higher prices pushed UK grocery sales to a record ?￡12.8 billion ($15.4 billion) over the four weeks to December 25, according to separate numbers published by data analytics company Kantar on Wednesday. That???s an increase of ?￡1.1 billion ($1.3 billion) on the previous year, even though sales measured by the number of items people bought were down 1% over the same period.
   
      ???This story played out across the traditional Christmas categories. For example, value sales of mince pies soared by 19% but volume purchases barely increased at all,??? said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar???s head of retail and consumer insight, in a report.
   
      While Kantar???s figures showed grocery price inflation falling for the second month in a row in December, it is still a ???painfully high figure, impacting how and what we buy at the shops,??? he added. 
   
      Sales of supermarkets??? own label products increased by 13.3% year on year over the four weeks to December 25, ???well ahead of a 4.7% increase in branded lines,??? McKevitt said. 
   
      Aldi remained the fastest-growing grocer in the United Kingdom last month, according to Kantar. Lidl???s sales increased by nearly 24%, its data showed. Tesco
            
                (TSCDF) and Sainsbury???s, the largest UK grocers by market share, grew sales by 6% and 6.2% respectively.

      Cristiano Ronaldo ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ湾roudﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・of move to Al Nassr and says his work in Europe is ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ賄oneﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・    
**************************
 
      Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was officially unveiled by his new Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on Tuesday in Riyadh, explaining he made the move having ???won everything??? in Europe.
   
      Ronaldo will earn an estimated $200 million a year with Al Nassr, according to Saudi state-owned media.
   
      ???I???m so proud to make this big decision in my life, in football. As you mentioned before, in Europe my work, it???s done. I won everything,??? the five-time Ballon d???Or winner said. ???I played the most important clubs in Europe and for me now, it???s a new challenge.???
   
      
      Cristiano Ronaldo signs for Saudi team Al Nassr
     
      The 37-year-old also revealed a number of clubs from around the world had attempted to sign him. 
   
      ???I had many opportunities in Europe, many clubs, in Brazil, in Australia, US, even in Portugal. Many clubs tried to sign me but I give the word to this club for the opportunity,??? he said.
   
      Despite a disappointing Qatar 2022 with Portugal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. He started Portugal???s round of 16 and quarterfinal matches on the substitutes bench, losing his place in the starting lineup after manager Fernando Santos opted to play Gon?§alo Ramos in his place.
   
      That came soon after his high-profile breakup with Manchester United, which was caused by an interview with TalkTV???s Piers Morgan where Ronaldo said he felt ???betrayed??? by the Premier League club.
   
      In the interview, he also stated he had a lack of respect for manager Erik ten Hag, and cast doubt on whether he would return to the team.
   
      Despite clearly slowing down on the pitch in the twilight of his career, the Portuguese star was adamant he would be able to have an impact with Al Nassr.
   
      ???I???m a unique player so it???s good coming here,??? Ronaldo said. ???I beat all records there so I want to beat a few records here as well.
   
      ???So for me, it???s a good chance, as you say this contract is unique, because I???m a unique player as well so for me it???s normal.???

      California man under arrest for attempted murder after police say he allegedly intentionally drove off a cliff with 1 woman and 2 children in car
    
**************************
 
      A 41-year-old California man was placed under arrest Tuesday on multiple charges after he allegedly intended to drive off a cliff on the Pacific Coast Highway with three passengers in the car, authorities said. 
   
      All four occupants of the Tesla survived the crash on Monday after the car plunged between 250 and 300 feet below the road it was on and into a rocky beach area known as Devil???s Slide, about 20 miles south from San Francisco, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
   
      
      Tesla plunges 250 feet off a California cliff, all 4 occupants survive
     
      In addition to the driver, an adult woman, a 9-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl were in the car when the crash happened Monday morning, according to Brian Pottenger, a battalion chief with Cal Fire???s Coastside Fire Protection District. 
   
      They were all taken to a local hospital with serious injuries, the highway patrol said Tuesday. The San Mateo County Sheriff???s Office previously said in a social media post that the children were ???unharmed.???
   
      ???Based on the evidence collected, investigators developed probable cause to believe this incident was an intentional act,??? the state???s highway patrol said in a news release Tuesday announcing the driver???s arrest. 
   
      The driver, from Pasadena, California, was arrested for attempted murder and child endangerment, according to the arrest report. He will be formally booked into San Mateo County Jail after his hospital treatment is completed, the highway patrol added. 
   
      The relationship between the driver and passengers remained unclear Tuesday. 
   
      The four-door, white Tesla was traveling southbound on Highway 1 just south of the Tom Lantos Tunnel between Pacifica and Montara on Monday morning when it veered off the roadway. It plunged at least 250 feet below that road, and a dramatic rescue mission ensued to ensure the occupants were taken out of the car safely. 
   
      ???The damage to the vehicle would indicate that it hit, and then flipped several times,??? Pottenger explained. The car came to rest on its wheels, he added.
   
      On Tuesday, the highway patrol pointed out that Tesla???s tech savvy driving features were not involved in what caused the crash. 
   
      ???There has been no determination as to what driving mode the Tesla was in; however, that does not appear to be a contributing factor in this incident,??? the highway patrol said. 
   
      The California Highway Patrol is investigating the crash. 
   
      The California Highway Patrol was alerted about the crash around 10:50 a.m. local time on Monday. 
   
      Upon first-responders arrival, all four occupants were conscious, and the two children were secured into their car seats that remained intact, according to Pottenger. All were trapped inside the smashed car, officials said. 
   
      
      Jennifer Hart drove her six children to their deaths as her wife looked up how much they would suffer, a jury says 
     
      The California Highway Patrol posted dramatic video of the helicopter lowering a rescuer on a cable to the crash site while surf crashed against the rocks below.
   
      As firefighters rappelled down the cliff to the car, other first-responders watched through binoculars. 
   
      ???As we were doing that, we were able to notice movement in the front seat through the windshield,??? Pottenger said. ???So we knew that we had at least one person that was alive.???
   
      Crews freed the two children and used a rope to lift them up the cliff in baskets. Later, a California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted the two adults to safety.

      Jeremy Renner thanks his fans for their sympathies in his first social media post after snow plowing accident
    
**************************
 
      Actor Jeremy Renner thanked fans from his hospital bed Tuesday as he continued to recover from two surgeries following being injured by a snowplow machine in what officials described as ???a tragic accident.???
   
      ???Thank you all for your kind words. Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all,??? Renner wrote in a caption under a selfie photo showing him apparently in a hospital bed.
   
      The ???Hawkeye??? actor was injured on New Year???s Day near his Nevada home while he was clearing snow from a private driveway to help family members leave his house after gathering for the holidays, according to his publicist, Samantha Mast. 
   
      ???Jeremy is making positive progress and is awake, talking and in good spirits,??? Mast said a statement released Tuesday evening. ???He remains in ICU in critical but stable condition. He is overwhelmed by the showing of love and support. The family asks for your continued thoughts while he heals with his close loved ones.???
   
      
      Jeremy Renner shares first photo since snow plowing accident
     
      Renner, 51, was run over by his snowcat, an engine-powered machine used to clear snow, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said on Tuesday during a news conference. 
   
      At some point, the machine started to roll away while Renner was not in the driver???s seat, Balaam said. He was injured as he tried to get back into the machine, Balaam explained. Renner???s family members were with him when he was injured. 
   
      A Renner spokesperson previously told CNN that he sustained ???blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries.??? So far, the actor has undergone two surgeries related to the injuries, a source close to the actor told CNN.
   
      Minutes before 9 a.m. on Sunday, authorities received word of the accident through a 911 call reporting a crash involving a snowcat and a pedestrian on Mount Rose Highway, Balaam said Tuesday.
   
      Even through it was not snowing at that time, that highway was closed and at least a dozen cars were stranded due to the severe winter weather that was hitting the area, Balaam said.  
   
      Due to these conditions, a helicopter landed in the vicinity of the highway at 9:37 a.m., and Renner was taken to a Reno-area hospital at 9:56 a.m., Balaam said.
   
      At the time of the injury, parts of western Nevada were blanketed with snow. The Reno area received between 6 and 12 inches of snow at elevations below 5,000 feet between New Year???s Eve and New Year???s Day, and up to 18 inches at higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Reno.
   
      ???He was being a great neighbor and he was plowing those roads for his neighbor,??? Balaam said of Renner. 
   
      Authorities do not believe Renner was intoxicated during the incident, with Balaam calling it ???a tragic accident.???
   
      
      Jeremy Renner suffered 'blunt chest trauma,' required second surgery for 'extensive' injuries
     
      The Washoe County Sheriff???s Office has Renner???s taken the snowcat to analyze it to ???rule out any potential mechanical failure,??? which is a normal part of the investigation with this severity of injuries, Balaam said.
   
      During an appearance on ???CNN This Morning??? Wednesday, Balaam said the actor is very active in the Reno community.
   
      ???He???s one of our honorary deputies here at the Sheriff???s Office,??? Balaam said. ???That???s one of the nonprofits [for] members in our community. And they help us do ???Shop For The Sheriff,??? where they spend $50,000 and donate it and he???s one of those members. He does a lot for our community.???
   
      ???When I took office in 2019 he showed up for ???Shop For The Sheriff??? and you should see the kids and the parents,??? Balaam added. ???He took the time out of his busy days to give autographs and shop with kids. He does a lot in the community and what I truly enjoy about Mr. Renner is a lot of times he does it and no one knows. He does it out of the kindness of his heart.???
   
      A day after the accident, Renner???s family released a statement thanking hospital staff and first responders while the actor remained hospitalized.
   
      ???Jeremy???s family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible doctors and nurses looking after him, Truckee Meadows Fire and Rescue, Washoe County Sheriff, Reno City Mayor Hillary Schieve and the Carano and Murdock families,??? a statement from his spokesperson read. ???They are also tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans.???

      US Soccer announces investigation into menﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 head coach Gregg Berhalter as he releases statement on 1991 domestic violence incident
    
**************************
 
      US Soccer has launched an investigation into men???s national team head coach Gregg Berhalter, the organization announced Tuesday, as the coach released a statement addressing a previous domestic violence incident between himself and his now-wife. 
   
      While US Soccer did not provide details of the incident, Berhalter issued a lengthy statement on Twitter Tuesday describing the moment in 1991 when he says he kicked his wife Rosalind, who was his girlfriend at the time, during an argument. The statement is signed by Berhalter and his wife. 
   
      ???There are zero excuses for my actions that night,??? he said in the statement, adding it was a ???shameful moment??? that he ???regrets to this day,??? and Rosalind eventually forgave him.
   
      
      Iran calls for US to be kicked out of 2022 World Cup after it changes Iran flag on social media to show support for protesters
     
      The soccer coach, who led the US at the 2022 Qatar World Cup, said someone contacted US Soccer during the World Cup ???saying they had information about me that would ???take me down.?????? 
   
      US Soccer said it immediately hired an outside firm to conduct an independent investigation.
   
      Berhalter said he and his wife have cooperated with the ongoing investigation. US Soccer also said it appreciated the couple ???coming forward to speak openly about this incident.???
   
      The statement from US Soccer also said that during the investigation, the organization became aware of other potential inappropriate behavior from outside US Soccer. 
   
      ???Through this process, U.S. Soccer has learned about potential inappropriate behavior towards multiple members of our staff by individuals outside of our organization. We take such behavior seriously and have expanded our investigation to include those allegations,??? US Soccer said. 
   
      The organization added that it launched a full ???technical review??? of the Men???s National Team Program last month in addition to the investigation and said it will announce who will lead the program???s January camp in the coming days. 
   
      Berhalter???s future with US Soccer remains uncertain. He was appointed to the position in December 2018.
   
      The coach???s statement concludes, ???While we would prefer not to speak about something so personal from so long ago in such a public forum, we are embracing this opportunity to share what has shaped us and how much we have grown and learned from this over the past 31 years.???

      Astronomers glimpsed a stellar nursery in a new light, thanks to the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy in Chile. 
   
      The VISTA telescope, located at the European Southern Observatory???s Paranal Observatory in Antofagasta, Chile, observed the Sh2-54 Nebula in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye. 
   
      While visible light, which is what we can see, is absorbed by interstellar dust, infrared light can pierce through thick dust clouds in space to reveal previously unseen details.

      Infrared imagery of nebulae is helping astronomers learn more about how stars form. The new image revealed a wealth of stars behind the orange glow of the nebula.
   
      Compare the infrared image, which is filled with starlight, to the visible light image of the Sh2-54 nebula using the slider below.
    
      Multiple nebulae, or clouds of gas and dust that fuel star formation, are located at the tail end of the Serpens constellation ??? so named because of its resemblance to a serpent. These star-birth hotspots include the Eagle, the Omega and the Sh2-54 nebulae.
   
      Astronomers focused in on the Sh2-54 Nebula, located about 6,000 light-years from Earth. The ???Sh??? in the cosmic object???s name is in reference to astronomer Stewart Sharpless, who was responsible for cataloging more than 300 nebulae in the 1950s.

      ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ賂iftedﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・Damar Hamlin is a ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ枠reat human being,ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・says former college teammate
    
**************************
 
      Damar Hamlin???s former high school and college teammate John Petrishen said the Buffalo Bills safety???s work ethic is matched by him being a ???good person.???
   
      Petrishen, who played with Hamlin at both Pittsburgh Central Catholic and the University of Pittsburgh, told CNN that as well as being ???gifted??? on the field, Hamlin is a ???great human being.???
   
      ???People tend to forget that underneath the helmet and the jersey is a human being and Damar Hamlin is a great human being,??? Petrishen said. ???I played with him for three years at high school and then for two years in college. 
   
      A Pennsylvania native, Hamlin joined the Bills in 2021 as a sixth-round draft pick (212th overall) from the University of Pittsburgh.
   
      Prior to that, he won a Pennsylvania state championship while at Pittsburgh Central Catholic high school in 2015, leading the team to a 15-1 record as one of the best-rated defenders in the state.
   
      ???And we???re friends, teammates, that???s my brother,??? added Petrishen. ???He???s a great person and is someone you can always count on for doing things the right way. 
   
      ???He leads by example, he???s the perfect role model for young kids to look up to, he gives back to his community; he checks all the boxes. He???s a great person.???
   
      After suffering a cardiac arrest mid-game on Monday, Hamlin remains sedated on a ventilator as doctors work toward getting him to breathe on his own, according to an update from the player???s uncle.
   
      The 24-year-old Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday night???s game against the Cincinnati Bengals, his team said, a moment that left players weeping, praying and embracing as their teammate was taken away by ambulance.
   
      Hamlin fell on his back just moments after getting up from an open field tackle of Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. It remains unclear what caused the cardiac arrest.
   
      Within 10 seconds of Hamlin???s collapse, Bills team trainers were treating him. An ambulance was on the field in less than five minutes, footage shows, and he was given CPR, according to an ESPN broadcast. 
   
      ???Hamlin received immediate medical attention on the field by team and independent medical staff and local paramedics. He was then transported to a local hospital where he is in critical condition,??? the NFL said in a statement.
   
      Hamlin???s collapse left players distraught ??? in tears, kneeling with arms around one another before returning to their locker rooms. The game was suspended with nearly six minutes left in the first quarter and later was officially postponed.
   
      Petrishen explained that he was on a flight when Hamlin collapsed, saying he got off the plane to ???a couple hundred texts??? sending prayers to Hamlin and checking in on Petrishen. 
   
      The former college linebacker remembers coming through the ranks with Hamlin, during which time the two formed a bond. 
   
      He also recalls hosting Hamlin at Penn State during his time at the college when Hamlin was considering joining. 
   
      ???I would say he is someone who leads by example with class. He???s not the most vocal person ??? people look to him to do things the right way,??? Petrishen outlined. 
   
      ???He has a great work ethic, he???s a great character, he leads from the front of the pack and people can look to him and know that what he???s doing, they can follow. He???s a good leader. Like I said, he leads by example. You always know what you???re going to get from Damar. 
   
      ???He shows up as the same person every day, he always gives great effort, in football and in life. He???s a light in the room, he???s a good person to be around.???
   
      At Pittsburgh Central Catholic, Hamlin???s jersey hangs in the weight room. And his high school coach, Terry Totten, described Hamlin as a ???quiet leader??? to the Athletic. 
   
      ???Somebody who was willing to reach across any lines to be a respected member of the school community,??? said Totten. 
   
      In a statement, University of Pittsburgh head football coach Pat Narduzzi called Hamlin ???far more than just a football player.???
   
      ???He???s a loving son, brother and friend. Damar is a hero to thousands of Pittsburgh kids,??? Narduzzi said.
   
      ???Damar, we love you. We are praying for you. Pittsburgh???s always had your back. And now it???s obvious the entire country has your back, too.???
   
      This season has been a breakthrough one for Hamlin, playing in every game after injuries to the Bills??? defensive backfield. According to ESPN, the safety has recorded 91 total tackles, 1.5 sacks, one forced fumble, and two passes defended in 15 games as the Bills (12-3) top the AFC East standings.
   
      Petrishen says he???s ???proud??? of the growth Hamlin has shown over the years and the success it has brought him. 
   
      ???He???s grown so much over the years and it???s awesome to see him get his chance in the NFL this year because he???s worked really hard and he deserves it,??? Petrishen said. 
   
      ???He???s obviously very gifted but he???s worked for that. He???s earned everything he???s received and nobody can ever take that away from him. 
   
      ???So I???m really proud of what he???s achieved this year and all the opportunities that have come his way because he deserves it.???

      Tom Zhu: Elon Muskﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 right-hand man at Tesla

            Latest Market News 
	

 
      Tesla???s China chief has reportedly been given a big promotion.
   
      Tom Zhu has been handed Tesla???s US assembly plants and sales operations in North America and Europe as additional responsibilities, leaving just the Berlin Gigafactory outside his remit, according to media reports on Tuesday.
   
      The reports have intensified speculation that China-born Zhu is being groomed to succeed Elon Musk as CEO at the world???s biggest electric carmaker. So, what do we know about him?
   
      Zhu, who is now the highest-profile Tesla executive after Musk, has played a huge role in helping the company rebound strongly from Covid lockdowns in China, the carmaker???s biggest international market.
   
      His reported appointment comes at a time when Musk has been distracted by his acquisition of Twitter, and Tesla???s stock has plunged 65% in 2022. 
   
      While Tesla did not respond to requests for comment by CNN, Chinese media has been speculating since December that Zhu was being groomed for a bigger global role at the electric automaker.
   
      ???Zhu is a core leader at Tesla and a linchpin to its success especially in China,??? said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst covering the tech industry at Wedbush Securities.
   
      
      Elon Musk is conspicuously quiet after Twitter users vote for him to step down amid chaotic policy changes
     
      Zhu joined Tesla in 2014 and has been described as ???pragmatic,??? ???industrious??? and ???a workaholic??? by the Chinese media. 
   
      ???I wanna sleep so much, but the job is so damn interesting,??? he said in a 2019 post on his Weibo account.
   
      Zhu has made few public appearances since joining Tesla, and there is little public information about his age or personal life. He was born in China and CNN was not able to confirm if he still holds Chinese citizenship.
   
      According to his social media profile, he acquired a bachelor???s degree from the Auckland University of Technology in 2004 and an MBA degree from The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. 
   
      Before joining Tesla, he founded a project management consulting firm, offering advice to Chinese contractors who wanted to expand overseas.
   
      A 2021 interview by the Jiefang Daily in Shanghai, the Communist Party???s official newspaper in the financial hub, showed Zhu working from an open office, with hardly any time to eat breakfast.
   
      ???Efficiency and pragmatism are a style of our company,??? he said in the interview, which is one of the few Zhu has appeared in since joining Tesla.
   
      In a separate video interview last year by PCauto, a privately owned Chinese news portal, Zhu revealed more about his personal life and working style.
   
      Tesla???s China boss does not embody a flashy lifestyle. He lives in a low-cost public rental home, paying a monthly rent of less than 2,000 yuan ($290), as it is close to the sprawling Shanghai factory. 
   
      Living close to work is ???quite convenient,??? Zhu said in the interview. He also car pools with colleagues and starts work at 6 or 7 in the morning, often staying beyond midnight. 
   
      He also revealed that he texted Musk regularly, discussing issues at work or plans for the future, which Zhu said made him ???feel extremely excited.???
   
      In 2019, after multiple typhoons hit the Shanghai plant???s drainage system, Zhu and other Tesla employees manually drained water with plastic buckets in the rain.
   
      ???Getting your hands dirty??? represents an entrepreneurial spirit and culture of of the company, he said.
   
      Zhu???s reported promotion came after an impressive performance by Tesla???s China operations.
   
      Since 2014, Tesla has expanded rapidly in the world???s largest car market. In 2019, it built the Shanghai Gigafactory within 10 months, at a cost that was 65% cheaper than the Model 3 production plant in the United States. 
   
      Within a few years, it became the biggest EV production plant on the planet.
   
      
      How Tesla's risky bet on making cars in China could pay off
     
      In 2021, Tesla delivered 936,000 vehicles globally, more than half of which came from the Shanghai factory. 
   
      In August 2022, Musk said the company had manufactured over three million cars, one million of which came from Shanghai. In November, the Shanghai factory set a fresh monthly delivery record of more than 100,000 vehicles. All this was achieved after Covid restrictions caused the plant to temporarily suspend production last year.
   
      Tesla???s China sales also beat expectations. For the first three quarters of 2022, Tesla generated revenue of $13.6 billion from China, up 51% from the same period a year ago.

      Tokyo is so crowded the government is paying families to leave

            Latest Market News 
	

 
      Japan is offering to pay families to move out of its overcrowded capital, in an effort to revitalize countryside towns and boost the falling birth rate.
   
      Starting in April, families in the Tokyo metropolitan area, including those headed by single parents, will be eligible to receive 1 million yen ($7,700) per child if they move to less-populated areas across the country, according to a spokesperson from the central government.
   
      The incentives apply to children aged under 18, or dependents 18 and over if they???re still attending high school.
   
      It???s not the first time the government has tried to use financial incentives to encourage people to leave, but this plan is more generous at three times the amount currently offered.
   
      For decades, people across Japan have migrated to its urban centers seeking job opportunities. Tokyo is the country???s most populous city, with roughly 37 million residents.
   
      Before the Covid pandemic, the number of people moving into Tokyo outnumbered those leaving the city by up to 80,000 each year, according to government statistics released in 2021.
   
      But this migration pattern, combined with Japan???s rapidly aging population, has left rural towns with fewer and fewer residents, as well as millions of unoccupied homes. More than half of the country???s municipalities, excluding Tokyo???s 23 wards, are expected to be designated as underpopulated areas in 2022, according to a national census.
   
      Meanwhile, in major cities, space has rapidly run out and prices have skyrocketed. Tokyo is consistently one of the world???s most expensive cities to live in, ranking fifth globally in 2022. 
   
      This problem, the migration of young people from the countryside to crowded cities, is a key factor in Japan???s larger demographic crisis, according to experts. The country has long struggled with low birth rates and long life expectancy, and has seen the number of deaths outnumber births in recent years.
   
      Experts point to several factors: the high cost of living, limited space and lack of childcare support in cities make it difficult to raise children, meaning fewer couples are having kids. Urban couples are also often far from extended family who could help provide support.
   
      For example, Tokyo has the lowest fertility rate of all 47 prefectures in Japan. 
   
      Current migration patterns are resulting in deserted hometowns with few children. In the riverside village of Nagoro in southern Japan, there were fewer than 30 residents in 2019, with the youngest resident over the age of 50. The village???s only school shut down a few years ago after its last students graduated.
   
      
      Japan has so many vacant homes it's giving them away
     
      To combat these issues, authorities launched an initiative in 2019 to attract people to regional areas.
   
      Under this plan, individuals who have lived and worked in the Tokyo metropolitan area for at least five years could receive 600,000 yen ($4,500) if they moved to rural areas. That incentive is higher for couples, at 1 million yen ($7,700).
   
      Last year, the government allowed single parents or couples with children to receive 300,000 yen ($2,300) per child if they relocated.
   
      Those who relocate could work in that area, set up their own business or keep working remotely at their Tokyo-based jobs, said the government spokesperson. 
   
      ???Tokyo has a very high concentration of people, and the government wants to increase the flow of people to the regional areas to revitalize areas with declining populations,??? he added.
   
      There is some evidence the program is gaining traction, though numbers are still low. In the first year of launch, only 71 households participated, compared to 1,184 households in 2021.
   
      Japan???s government has also made other efforts to address the population decline, including introducing policies in the past few decades to enhance child care services and improve housing facilities for families with children. Some rural towns have even begun paying couples who live there to have children.

      What to do if someone is in cardiac arrest
    
**************************
 
      If you suspect that someone has gone into cardiac arrest, there are some simple steps you can take right away that could mean the difference between life and death.
   
      About 70% to 90% of people who go into cardiac arrest in the US die before they get to a hospital because the people around them don???t always know how to help. 
   
      Cardiac arrest is when a person???s heart abruptly stops beating. 
   
      
      Damar Hamlin's doctors are working to get him breathing without a ventilator after his mid-game cardiac arrest left him in critical condition
     
      ???The most common rhythm that you???ll see is something called ventricular fibrillation, which is basically like the heart is like a bag of worms. It???s beating chaotically, and it???s no longer able to effectively pump,??? said Dr. Christine Albert, director of the Cardiology Department at the Smidt Heart Institute in Los Angeles. 
   
      ???The person collapses because the brain is no longer working, and there???s just a couple of minutes that you have to try to get that rhythm back to a normal rhythm.???
   
      Warning signs can include shortness of breath, a pounding heart, weakness and chest discomfort. But more often than not, cardiac arrest happens without warning.
   
      Someone who???s in cardiac arrest will not have a pulse and won???t respond to sound or touch. They???ll either stop breathing or make gasping-like sounds, which aren???t true breathing but a reflex that happens when the brain isn???t getting enough oxygen.
   
      Cardiac arrest can be caused by irregular heart rhythms called arrhythmias. Heart failure can cause it, as can thickening of the heart muscle called cardiomyopathy.
   
      Cardiac arrest can follow a heart attack, which is when a blockage keeps the heart from getting enough blood. The muscle starts to die, but unlike with cardiac arrest, it will continue to pump.
   
      It might also happen because of electrocution, drowning, choking, respiratory distress or trauma. A hard strike to the chest, as for a baseball player, could knock the heart out of rhythm.
   
      If you see someone with symptoms of cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately. You want to get professional help there as quickly as possible. When the heart can???t pump blood to the brain and the lungs, the person may become brain-damaged or die within minutes.
   
      If someone else is around, divide the duties. One person should call 911 while the other looks for an automated external defibrillator, or AED.
   
      These lightweight devices can jolt a person???s heart back into regular rhythm. They???re often found in public places like airports, offices and schools. An AED may look daunting, but it???s designed for use by anyone, even untrained bystanders.
   
      When you press the power button, the device will give you step-by-step voice instructions on where to put the electrode pads on the person???s chest.
   
      Once the pads are in place, the device measures the person???s heart rhythm. It won???t deliver a shock if the person doesn???t need one. But if they do, the AED will tell you to stand back and push a button to deliver the shock.
   
      After using the AED ??? or right away, if you don???t have access to one ??? start chest compressions.
   
      
      What are cardiac arrest, heart attack and heart failure?
     
      Put your hands in the center of the person???s chest and press hard at 100 to 120 beats per minute. It may help to hum a song with this tempo like ???Stayin??? Alive??? by the Bee Gees, Justin Timberlake???s ???Can???t Stop the Feeling??? or Lady Gaga???s ???Just Dance.???
   
      ???You are literally acting like an external heart,??? said Dr. Comilla Sasson, a practicing emergency medicine physician and vice president for science and innovation for emergency cardiovascular care with the American Heart Association.
   
      It can get tiring, she said, so if someone else is nearby, have them take over when you need a break. If they don???t know CPR, have them watch you first. ???That???s what we do in the emergency room,??? Sasson said. 
   
      Locking your elbows gives you more leverage to push. With an adult, you???d typically use both hands for the chest compressions. But if you???re helping a baby, use one hand. 
   
      ???Some people will ask me, ???what if I do chest compressions and break a rib and hurt them???? I tell them that this person is literally dead, and if they are fortunate to wake up because you did chest compressions, they???re going to be happy that you helped save their life. There???s a small number of people that get a broken rib,??? Sasson said.
   
      Many organizations offer CPR and AED training. 
   
      The American Heart Association and the Red Cross offer in-person courses, as do many local organizations. 
   
      The Heart Association and the Red Cross also offer hands-on training sessions with instructors that are all online. 
   
      Sasson says it???s important that parents of young athletes have a conversation with the child???s coach to make sure they have a cardiac response plan in place that includes CPR and an AED. If someone has an incident at school, on the field or during an extracurricular activity, everyone will know what to do.
   
    Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
   
      Families should also make sure they have a plan at home just in case. 
   
      ???Who???s going to call 911? Who???s going to start chest compressions? Who???s going to open the door when the ambulance arrives? Just talking about it helps. I think of this like a tornado drill,??? Sasson said. ???Hopefully, you???ll never need to know what to do, but if that situation happens, you want to have a plan in place about what you???re going to do to help keep your loved one alive.???

      Buffalo Bills player Dion Dawkins describes moment he realized ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・omething is really, really wrongﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・after Damar Hamlinﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 collapse
    
**************************
 
      Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Dion Dawkins has recalled the moment he realized something was ???really, really wrong??? after teammate Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field against the Cincinnati Bengals. 
   
      Hamlin remains in hospital and in a critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest in Monday???s game. His uncle, Dorrian Glenn, told CNN that Hamlin is still sedated having been resuscitated twice ??? on the field and then at the hospital. 
   
      The game was subsequently postponed with players from both teams visibly distraught. 
   
      ???You look around and you see the medical staff doing their job, and you know when it???s something minor like somebody is down, but they???re sitting up, the guys are moving at a nice pace,??? Dawkins told CNN???s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.
   
      ???But when things like this are going on, they???re waving really fast and calling guys on the field and calling for the elite medical staff ??? that???s when you really realize that something is really, really wrong.
   
      ???This was one of the first experiences for myself where something like this has happened in this type of way, where it silenced an entire stadium that was at an uproar half a play earlier.???
   
      Live updates: NFL star Damar Hamlin in critical condition after cardiac arrest
   
      According to Glenn, Hamlin is on a ventilator to relieve some of the strain on his lungs, which have been damaged following the cardiac arrest. He said his nephew???s condition is ???trending upwards in a positive way??? while receiving treatment in hospital. 
   
      For Dawkins, who is in his sixth season with the Bills, the gravity of the situation immediately made him turn to prayer. 
   
      ???Whether you???re a believer or not, only a higher power can really take control of what is next,??? he said.  
   
      ???Our people that helped also assisted that higher power. But in that moment you kind of just have to be vulnerable and let prayer go up and work its magic.???
   
      
      'Gifted' Damar Hamlin is a 'great human being,' says former college teammate
     
      On Tuesday, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the game between the Bills and the Bengals will not be resumed this week, adding that no decision has been made on when it might be played. 
   
      ???I???m truly blessed that we didn???t have to keep playing,??? said Dawkins.
   
      ???The fact that we did not have to go back out there on that field and play just shows that there is care, and that???s all we can ever ask for is that we get treated as people,??? he added.
   
      ???Most people just treat us as athletes, as superstars, and some people like celebrities, but in that moment they [the NFL] treated us like people. And being treated as a person that is cared for, it???s a beautiful feeling. 
   
      ???I???m thankful that I was treated as a person and so were the rest of my teammates because at the end of the day, we are people. And we have feelings, we have emotions, we cry, we hurt. And we have families, and they hurt, and they cry.???

      Gabrielle Union ﾃ｢ﾂﾂ惑elt entitledﾃ｢ﾂﾂ・to infidelity during first marriage
    
**************************
 
      Gabrielle Union is sharing more about her first marriage that she describes as ???dysfunctional from day one.???
   
      During a recent conversation on the podcast ???Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,??? the actress and author talked about being married to former professional football player Chris Howard, whom she divorced in 2006 after five years of marriage.
   
      Shepard mentioned feeling guilty about his own past infidelities and Union allowed that she was not ???getting wife of the year awards??? when it came to her marriage to the ex-Jacksonville Jaguars player.
   
      ???In my first marriage, neither one of us felt like the marriage should get in the way of our dating,??? she said. ???A part of it was like keeping up with his activities, like, ???Oh, that???s what you???re doing? You???re going to feel this one.??? And I just felt entitled to it as well.???
   
      ???The Inspection??? star said she ???was paying all the bills. I was working my a** off and I felt like that???s what comes, the spoils of riches.???
   
      Union has been married to another former professional athlete, NBA star Dwyane Wade, since 2014. She said she wishes she felt more guilt about her behavior during her first marriage. 
   
      ???It was such a stupid relationship that should have never got out of the dating phase,??? she said of her marriage to Howard. 
   
      CNN has reached out to Howard for comment.

      Lionel Messi returns to Paris Saint-Germain training after Argentinaﾃ｢ﾂﾂ冱 World Cup victory
    
**************************
 
      Lionel Messi has returned to the Paris Saint-Germain training center after winning the World Cup with Argentina last month.
   
      A tweet from the club???s official account on Wednesday reads: ???Welcome back Leo,??? accompanied by a video of the 35-year-old arriving at the complex. 
   
      A separate post shows images of Messi being greeted by teammates in the dressing room, including Brazil star Neymar.
   
      Messi returns to the French club at an important time, with the team having lost for the first time this season against Lens last weekend. PSG???s lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table has been cut to just four points as a result.
   
      The team???s next game is against Chatearoux in the French Cup on Friday ??? a game that may come too soon for Messi. 
   ?????????? pic.twitter.com/C2Q60MIOLn 
      His return to Paris comes on the same day his long-time rival Cristiano Ronaldo was unveiled at his new club Al Nassr. 
   
      The Portugal star signed for the Saudi Arabian club last week after his high-profile exit from Manchester United in November last year. 
   
      And on Tuesday, the 37-year-old was presented to fans in Riyadh, referring to his multiple on-the-field accomplishments as to why he made the move out of Europe.
   
      ???I???m so proud to make this big decision in my life, in football ??? In Europe, my work is done. I won everything,??? the five-time Ballon d???Or winner said. ???I played for the most important clubs in Europe and for me now, it???s a new challenge.???
   
      Ronaldo added: ???I had many opportunities in Europe, many clubs ??? in Brazil, in Australia, US, even in Portugal ??? many clubs tried to sign me, but I give the word to this club for the opportunity.???

      Snooker investigates Chinese players over alleged match-fixing scandal
    
**************************
 
      Snooker???s governing body on Tuesday said it had suspended two more Chinese players as it investigates an alleged match-fixing and betting scandal ??? bringing the number of players from the Asian country caught up in the probe to 10.
   
      In a statement, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) said former UK Championship winner Zhao Xintong, 25, and his compatriot Zhang Jiankang, 24, were barred from attending or competing on the World Snooker Tour with immediate effect. 
   
      ???This decision is part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of manipulating the outcome of matches for betting purposes in breach of the WPBSA Conduct Regulations,??? the statement said. 
   
      ???The suspension will remain in place until the conclusion of the investigation or any subsequent charges that may or may not be brought. Both Zhao and Zhang have the right to appeal this decision.???
   
      World No. 9 Zhao is widely considered one of snooker???s brightest talents. He will now miss the Masters in London on Sunday, one of the sport???s biggest annual tournaments.
   
      CNN has reached out to both players for comment. 
   
      Former world No. 11 Liang Wenbo was the first player from China suspended in connection with the investigation in October. A further seven Chinese players, including 2021 Masters champion Yan Bingtao were suspended in December.
   
      CNN has reached out to both Liang and Yan for comment. Neither Liang or Yan have publicly commented on the ongoing investigation.
   
      The specific details regarding the allegations related to the individual suspended players remains unknown. The source of the original allegations also remains unclear.
   
      ???The WPBSA can confirm that the wider investigation is now at an advanced stage, and it is anticipated will be completed shortly at which point any potential charges will be considered,??? the WPBSA statement added.
   
      In a statement Tuesday, the Chinese Billiards and Snooker Association said it ???firmly opposes game manipulation, gambling and other acts that violate sports integrity and ethics, and will make further punishments based on the final investigation results released by the WPBSA.???
   
      Snooker, which shares many similarities with he US game of pool, is a two-person sport played on a large, green table using cues. 
   
      The objective is to take turns to hit the white cue ball to pot one of 15 red balls each worth 1 point, before sinking one of 6 different colored balls ??? worth between 2 and 7 points ??? into the 6 pockets around the table.
   
      The player who scores the most points wins an individual frame, with the overall winner reaching a certain amount of frames.
   
      Traditionally the sport has been dominated by players from the UK and US, but in recent years has seen an influx of Chinese talent, with the sport soaring in popularity in the East Asian country.
